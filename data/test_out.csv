Refractory-Celiac-Disease,"Refractory celiac disease (RCD) is a complex autoimmune disorder much like the more common celiac disease but, unlike celiac disease, it is resistant or unresponsive to at least 12 months of treatment with a strict gluten-free diet. Gliadin, a component of the wheat storage protein gluten, together with similar proteins in barley and rye, are the villains that trigger the immune reaction in celiac disease. The diagnosis of RCD is made by exclusion, especially of any other disorder that can affect the huge number of thread-like projections that line the interior of the intestine (intestinal villi), such as intestinal lymphoma, Crohn's disease, small intestinal bacterial overgrowth or hypogammaglobulinemia. Refractory celiac disease is rare among adults and is almost never seen in children. Data regarding the true incidence and prevalence of RCD are unreliable, but some have estimated that there might be 20,000 patients in the USA. However, those estimations are based on incomplete data. In one recent study, 1.5% of patients diagnosed with celiac disease at a single US center developed RCD. Of those with RCD 85% had the less severe Type I RCD. Virtually all clinicians studying refractory celiac disease emphasize that the diagnosis is based on eliminating all other possible sources of the symptoms and intestinal injury. One article lists more than 10 conditions that must be considered and eliminated before a convincing diagnosis of refractory celiac disease may be made. As noted above, examination of the interior wall of the intestine (upper and lower) by means of an enteroscope or colonoscope as well as obtaining intestinal biopsies to be examined under a microscope is useful, especially to determine if the symptoms are the result of intestinal disorders other than RCD. Capsule endoscopy, which examines the small intestinal lining using a camera mounted on a swallowed pill, may also be useful in evaluating the degree of small intestinal inflammation and injury.  Some specialized centers are able to offer sophisticated examinations of the biopsy materials that in many cases will assist in the diagnosis. These studies emphasize the presence of abnormal populations of T lymphocytes in the tissue indicating a diagnosis of the more aggressive Type II RCD. Other imaging studies (barium X-ray, CT scan, capsule enteroscopy and MRE) may be undertaken, especially if there is concern for the presence of a lymphoma. Several therapies for RCD have been tried in uncontrolled tests with inconclusive results. Among the therapies tested in this way are: elemental diet (an elemental diet is a liquid diet consisting of nutrients that require no digestion, including amino acids, carbohydrates, vitamins, minerals, and triglycerides); and total parental nutrition (TPN) that is defined as nutrition maintained entirely by intravenous injection or by some other nongastrointestinal route. Steroid therapy is a mainstay of treatment but its beneficial effect is short-lived in patients of lymphoma. Treatment involving other immunosuppressive drugs such as azathioprine, cyclosporine, enteric-coated budesonide, 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA), or inflixamab has been used with a limited number of patients.  More recently chemotherapy with cladribine with or without autologous stem cell transplantation has also been reported to be useful.","Refractory celiac disease, lymphoma, Crohn's disease, refractory celiac disease, RCD, Type I RCD, intestinal lymphoma, Type II RCD",RAREDISEASE
Hemimegalencephaly,"Hemimegalencephaly (HME) is a rare neurological condition in which one-half of the brain, or one side of the brain, is abnormally larger than the other. The structure of the brain on the affected side may be markedly abnormal or show only subtle changes. In either case, as a consequence of this size and structural differences, the enlarged brain tissue causes frequent seizures, often associated with cognitive or behavioral disabilities. Seizures in association with HME often begin in early infant life including an association with infantile spasms. Hemimegalencephaly may occur as an isolated or sporadic brain malformation or it may be associated with other neurodevelopmental syndromes. Thus, when detected, HME should prompt a search for other syndromic diagnoses. Hemimegalencephaly is a very rare disorder for which prevalence estimates are not available. Examination by MRI is usually sufficient to confirm a suspected case of HME. Thus, an MRI examination should be performed as soon as HME is suspected. Seizures are diagnosed and defined by electroencephalography (EEG).","infantile spasms, Hemimegalencephaly, brain malformation, HME",RAREDISEASE
Lowe-syndrome,"Lowe syndrome is a rare genetic disorder that occurs almost exclusively in males. The prevalence is estimated to be between 1 and 10 males per 1,000,000 people. This condition has been reported in North and South America, Europe, Japan, and India.",Lowe syndrome,RAREDISEASE
Adenylosuccinate-Lyase-Deficiency,"Adenylosuccinate lyase deficiency (ASLD) is a rare, inherited metabolic disorder due to a lack of the enzyme adenylosuccinate lyase (ASL). The defect is characterized by the appearance of two unusual chemicals, succinylaminoimidazole carboxamide riboside (SAICA riboside) and succinyladenosine, in cerebrospinal fluid, in urine and, to a much smaller extent, in plasma. These compounds, which are never found in healthy individuals, are formed from the two natural compounds acted upon by the enzyme. The symptoms and the physical findings associated with ASLD vary greatly from case to case. As a rule, patients with ASLD present with a mix of neurological symptoms that usually will include some of the following: psychomotor retardation, autistic features, epilepsy, axial hypotonia with peripheral hypertonia, muscle wasting, and secondary feeding problems. Although abnormal physical features (dysmorphism) are not common, when they do occur they may include severe growth failure, small head circumference, brachycephaly, flat occiput, prominent metopic suture, intermittent divergent strabismus, small nose with anteverted nostrils, long and smooth philtrum, thin upper lip, and low set ears.","ASLD, Adenylosuccinate lyase deficiency",RAREDISEASE
Botulism,"Clostridium botulinum. The clinical diagnosis of botulism may be made based upon a thorough clinical evaluation and a detailed patient history. The mouse bioassay is the “gold standard” method for laboratory confirmation of the clinical diagnosis and may demonstrate the presence of botulinum toxin in serum, gastric fluid, stool, or food (foodborne botulism) specimens. Botulism can also be confirmed by culture of C. botulinum organisms from gastric fluid, stool, or a contaminated wound (wound botulism).","foodborne botulism, wound botulism, Botulism, botulism",RAREDISEASE
Mucopolysaccharidosis-Type-I,"Mucopolysaccharidosis type I affects males and females in equal numbers, with an incidence of about 1 in 100,000 live births for the severe type, and an incidence of about 1in 500,000 live births for the attenuated type. Incidence is the number of people who develop a disorder over a given period of time (e.g. one year). The incidence for MPS disorders collectively is about 1 in 25,000. However, rare disorders, especially milder forms of MPS, often go misdiagnosed or undiagnosed, making it difficult to determine the true frequency in the general population.","Mucopolysaccharidosis type I, MPS",RAREDISEASE
Tetralogy-of-Fallot,"The diagnosis of tetralogy of Fallot is confirmed by clinical evaluation and physical examination. A variety of specialized tests including electrocardiogram, echocardiogram, and cardiac catheterization may be performed to aid in diagnosis and therapy. When tetralogy of Fallot is present, x-ray studies usually reveal a normal-sized heart that is characteristically boot-shaped (coeur en sabot). Periodic measurements of systemic blood oxygen saturation and hemoglobin are also advisable. Infants with this disorder usually have a relatively loud murmur over the upper left breastbone.",tetralogy of Fallot,RAREDISEASE
Kohler-Disease,"Kohler disease is a rare bone disorder of the foot in children that may be the result of stress-related compression at a critical time during the period of growth. It is characterized by limping caused by pain and swelling in the foot. It most often occurs in children between the ages 3-7, and affects males five times more often than females. Usually, just one foot is affected so children typically walk on the side portion of the foot. A diagnosis of Kohler disease is suspected based on the presence of the signs of symptoms in the child. The clinical diagnosis of Kohler disease is reinforced by X-rays that show flattening, sclerosis, and fragmentation of the navicular bone, which can be compared to the unaffected side to make the diagnosis. However, these abnormalities of the navicular bone are bilateral in approximately 25% of patients and may be seen in children who do not have Kohler disease.",Kohler disease,RAREDISEASE
Prune-Belly-Syndrome,"Prune-Belly syndrome, also known as Eagle-Barrett syndrome, is a rare disorder characterized by partial or complete absence of the stomach (abdominal) muscles, failure of both testes to descend into the scrotum (bilateral cryptorchidism), and/or urinary tract malformations. The urinary malformations may include abnormal widening (dilation) of the tubes that bring urine to the bladder (ureters), accumulation of urine in the ureters (hydroureter) and the kidneys (hydronephrosis), and/or backflow of urine from the bladder into the ureters (vesicoureteral reflux). Complications associated with Prune-Belly syndrome may include underdevelopment of the lungs (pulmonary hypoplasia) and/or chronic renal failure. The exact cause of Prune-Belly syndrome is not known. Prune Belly syndrome is a very rare disorder that is present at birth.  The disorder affects mostly males but a few female cases have been described in the medical literature. The diagnosis is usually obvious from birth, but care and time are required to determine the location and number of abnormalities. A full understanding of the complications will involve imaging tests such as ultrasound, X-ray, and, in order to determine the extent of involvement of the genitourinary tract, intravenous pyelogram (IVP). An IVP makes use of a dye to map the degree of involvement of the kidneys and their ducts.","Prune Belly syndrome, Prune-Belly syndrome, Eagle-Barrett syndrome",RAREDISEASE

Castleman-Disease,"UCD and iMCD affect males and females in equal numbers, and there are no known factors that increase the risk of UCD or iMCD. HHV-8-associated MCD affects males at an increased rate compared to females. All types of Castleman disease may affect individuals of any age. Persons with HIV are at increased risk of developing HHV-8-associated MCD. It is estimated that there are approximately 5,000 individuals diagnosed each year and 30,000 individuals in the United States afflicted with one of the forms of Castleman disease.","HHV-8-associated MCD, UCD, iMCD, Castleman disease",RAREDISEASE
Pneumocystis-Pneumonia,"Pneumocystis pneumonia is characterized by a gradual onset with shortness of breath and/or difficulty breathing. This disorder may be accompanied with fevers, night sweats, weight loss and dry cough. Dry cough is one distinction from typical pneumonia because spit (sputum) is too thick to become productive, therefore productive cough is not as common in PJP. Uncommonly, the PJP fungus can spread to other body organs such as the liver, kidney and spleen as the disease progresses. PJP is a frequent AIDS-defining diagnosis in the United States and in Europe. Pneumocystis pneumonia is commonly seen in HIV infected people with a CD4 count of less than 200 cells/mm3. People receiving high doses of glucocorticoids or other immunosuppressive drugs after an organ transplant or to treat cancer are at risk for PJP. People with other inflammatory conditions such as granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener’s), polymyositis or dermatomyositis can also have an increased risk of acquiring PJP. The diagnosis of Pneumocystis pneumonia requires multiple tests such as a chest X-ray and a sample of sputum collected by a procedure called bronchoalveolar lavage to differentiate PJP between from other causes of pneumonia. To further confirm PJP, a test to amplify trace amounts of DNA (polymerase chain reaction or PCR) is used and a blood test to detect β-D-glucan is used.","Pneumocystis pneumonia, polymyositis, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, PJP",RAREDISEASE
Cone-Dystrophy,"Cone dystrophy is a general term used to describe a group of rare eye disorders that affect the cone cells of the retina. Cone dystrophy can variably cause a variety of symptoms including decreased visual clarity (acuity) when looking straight ahead (central vision), a reduced ability to see colors and an increased sensitivity to light (photophobia). Cone dystrophy may be broken down into two broad groups - stationary and progressive. In stationary cone dystrophy symptoms tend to remain stable and are usually present at birth or early childhood. In progressive cone dystrophy symptoms slowly become worse over time. There are several different forms of cone dystrophy. The age of onset, progression and severity of cone dystrophy can vary greatly from one person to another, even among individuals with the same type of cone dystrophy. Some forms of cone dystrophy are inherited; other forms appear to occur spontaneously for no apparent reason (sporadically). Cone dystrophy affects males and females in equal numbers when it occurs sporadically or is inherited as an autosomal dominant or recessive trait. The X-linked recessive form of cone dystrophy only affects males fully, although some females may have mild symptoms of the disorder. The exact incidence of cone dystrophy is unknown and estimates tend to vary in the medical literature. Most sources estimate the incidence as approximately 1 in 30,000 individuals in the general population. Cone dystrophy is usually present in early infancy or during childhood or early adulthood. However, the disorder has been reported to develop in individuals of all ages including older adults.","cone dystrophy, Cone dystrophy, X-linked recessive cone dystrophy, progressive cone dystrophy",RAREDISEASE
Testicular-Cancer,"Testicular cancer is an uncommon form of cancer and accounts for only 1% of all cancers in men. However, it is the most common form of cancer in men between the ages of 15 and 35. Approximately 8,850 men are diagnosed with testicular cancer each year in the United States. A variety of conditions can cause signs and symptoms that are similar to those seen in testicular cancer. This can include testicular torsion, epididymitis, epididymoorchitis, hydrocele, varicocele, hematoma, spermatocele, and syphilitic gumma. Testicular torsion in when a testicle rotates and twists around the spermatic cord (a collection of vessels, nerves, and ducts that runs to and from the testicles). Epididymitis is inflammation of the long, narrow, tightly coiled tube (epididymis) found behind each testicle. The epididymis carries sperm from the testicle to the spermatic duct. Epididymoorchitis is inflammation of the epididymis and the testicles. Hydrocele occurs when fluid builds up in the sac that surrounds the testicle leading to swelling and heaviness or discomfort of the affected testicle. Varicocele is the abnormal enlargement of the veins within the scrotum that can cause a feeling of discomfort or pain and impair fertility. A hematoma is a collection or small mass made up of clotted blood. A spermatocele is a noncancerous (benign) cyst that forms close to a testicle. Syphilitic gumma is a small, growth that can form in some people with syphilis.","Testicular cancer, testicular cancer",RAREDISEASE
Mitochondrial-Neurogastrointestinal-Encephalopathy,"Mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal encephalomyopathy (MNGIE) is a rare multisystem disorder characterized by progressive degeneration of the muscles of the gastrointestinal tract causing gastrointestinal dysmotility, weakness of extra-ocular muscles causing drooping of the eyelids (ptosis) and restricted eye movements (ophthalmoparesis), degeneration of peripheral nerves causing altered sensation and weakness the distal arms and legs, and general wasting (cachexia). The specific symptoms associated with MNGIE vary from case to case and may include vomiting, nausea, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and numbness or sensations of pins and needles in the hands and feet. . Additional findings may occur in some cases.

Brown-Sequard-Syndrome,"Brown-Séquard syndrome is a rare spinal disorder that results from an injury to one side of the spinal cord in which the spinal cord is damaged but is not severed completely. It is usually caused by an injury to the spine in the region of the neck or back. In many cases, affected individuals have received some type of puncture wound in the neck or in the back that damages the spine and causes symptoms to appear. Brown-Séquard syndrome is a rare disorder that affects males and females in equal numbers. More than 500 cases have been reported to date. The incidence of Brown-Séquard syndrome has been estimated to be 2% of all traumatic spinal cord injuries. The annual incidence of all forms of spinal cord injury is estimated to be 30-40 per 1,000,000 people.","Brown-Séquard syndrome, spinal cord injury",RAREDISEASE
Leprosy,"Leprosy is a chronic infectious disease of humans caused by the bacteria Mycobacterium leprae.  For many years, it was considered a mysterious disorder associated with some type of curse, and persons with the disease were isolated and ostracized. Today, there is effective treatment and the disease can be cured. There is no longer any justification for isolating persons with leprosy. There are no closely related diseases. The diagnosis can usually be made by the history and characteristic findings on examination. The important findings are decreased ability to feel light touch in a skin spot, enlarged or tender nerves in the arms or legs, numbness in a hand or foot, and finding the bacteria in the skin. There may also be loss of hair in the affected skin areas. A special type of skin smear is commonly done and will demonstrate the bacteria in the skin in lepromatous and borderline lepromatous cases. The bacteria are too few in tuberculoid cases to be found in a skin smear. A skin biopsy of a lesion can also be helpful to confirm the diagnosis. There are no blood tests or skin tests at the present time that are helpful in the diagnosis.","Leprosy, leprosy",RAREDISEASE
Small-Cell-Lung-Cancer,"The incidence of small cell lung cancer in the United States has been declining over the last two decades, which most researchers attribute to the decline in smoking in the country. Lung cancer, as a group, is the second most common form of cancer in the United States. SCLC accounts for about 10%-15% of people who have lung cancer. There are about 30,000 to 35,000 new people diagnosed with SCLC each year in the United States. Almost everyone who develops SCLC has a history of smoking.

Chromosome-22-Ring,"Chromosome 22 Ring is a rare disorder characterized by abnormalities of the 22nd chromosome. Associated symptoms and findings may be extremely variable from case to case. However, the disorder is typically associated with moderate to severe mental retardation. Some affected individuals may also have relatively mild, nonspecific physical (i.e., dysplastic) features, whereas others may have more distinctive, potentially severe physical abnormalities. According to reports in the medical literature, common findings include diminished muscle tone (hypotonia) and motor incoordination; an unsteady manner of walking (gait); pronounced verbal delays; and/or certain malformations of the skull and facial (craniofacial) region. Such craniofacial abnormalities may include an unusually small head (microcephaly); vertical skin folds that may cover the eyes' inner corners (epicanthal folds); unusually large ears; and/or other malformations. Chromosome 22 Ring is usually caused by spontaneous or ""de novo"" errors very early in the development of the embryo that appear to occur randomly for unknown reasons. Based upon observed cases, Chromosome 22 Ring has appeared to affect females more frequently than males.  Over 50 cases have been reported in the medical literature.",Chromosome 22 Ring,RAREDISEASE
Chromosome-11-Partial-Monosomy-11q,"Partial monosomy 11q, also known as Jacobsen syndrome, is a rare chromosomal disorder in which a portion of chromosome 11 is deleted (missing). The range and severity of symptoms varies, greatly depending on the exact location and size of the missing genetic material. Symptoms commonly associated with partial monosomy 11q include abnormally slow growth before and after birth (prenatal and postnatal physical growth retardation), moderate to severe delay in the acquisition of skills requiring the coordination of mental and muscular activity and intellectual disability. Rarely, individuals may have normal/borderline intelligence while most children have mild to severe intellectual disability. Characteristic physical abnormalities may include dimorphism (unusual shape) of the head and face (craniofacial), hands, feet, congenital defects of the ear, bleeding due to platelet abnormalities, and immunological defects. The exact cause of partial monosomy 11q is not fully understood. Partial monosomy 11q is an extremely rare chromosomal disorder that is apparent at birth. The disorder was initially described in the medical literature in 1973. Since that time, more than 200 cases have been described in the medical literature.

Pallister-W-Syndrome,"Pallister W syndrome is a rare genetic disorder characterized by unusual facial features such as clefting of the palate and the upper lip, a broad flat nose, widely spaced slanted eyes, and/or downslanting eyelid folds (palpebral fissures). Other symptoms may include mental retardation, speech problems, bone deformities of the arms and legs, and/or seizures. The exact cause of Pallister W syndrome is not known. Pallister W syndrome is apparent at birth.  It is characterized by widely spaced eyes (hypertelorism) with downward slanting eyelid folds (palpebral fissures), a broad flat nasal bridge, a broad tip of the nose, a broad flat jaw, central clefting of the palate or upper lip, seizures, and mental retardation.  There may also be bone abnormalities in the arms and legs such as abnormal deviation of the elbow away from the body when the arm is extended (cubitus valgus).  Other symptoms may include hair that does not lie flat on the head (cowlick), missing teeth (partial adontia), broad uvula, and a high broad forehead.  Additional findings may include tremor and/or involuntary muscle contractions (i.e., spasticity). Pallister W syndrome is a very rare disorder.  As of  the year 2000, only six cases had been reported in the medical literature.  More than half involved male infants but the numbers are not large enough to draw any conclusions regarding whether it affects one sex more than the other.

Arthrogryposis-Multiplex-Congenita,"Arthrogryposis is a general or descriptive term for the development of nonprogressive contractures affecting one or more areas of the body prior to birth (congenitally). A contracture is a condition in which a joint becomes permanently fixed in a bent (flexed) or straightened (extended) position, completely or partially restricting the movement of the affected joint. When congenital contractures occur only in one body area, it is not referred to as arthrogryposis but rather an isolated congenital contracture. The most common form of an isolated congenital contracture is clubfoot. When arthrogryposis affects two or more different areas of the body, it may be referred to as arthrogryposis multiplex congenita (AMC). The most common form of AMC is amyoplasia. Arthrogryposis and arthrogryposis multiplex congenita are sometimes used interchangeably. The number of males and females affected by AMC is approximately equal. The condition has been reported in individuals of Asian, African and European descent. Isolated congenital contractures affect approximately 1 in 500 individuals in the general population. AMC affects approximately 1 in 3,000 individuals. AMC is, by definition, present at birth (congenital). A diagnosis of AMC is made based upon identification of characteristic symptoms (e.g., multiple congenital contractures), a detailed patient history, and a thorough clinical evaluation. Certain tests may be necessary to determine the underlying cause of AMC including nerve conduction, electromyography and muscle biopsy, which can help diagnose neuropathic or myopathic disorders. A nerve conduction study measures how rapidly nerves carry an electrical impulse. An electromyography is a test that records electrical activity in skeletal voluntary muscles at rest and during muscle contraction. A biopsy is a procedure in which a small amount of affected tissue (e.g., muscle) is removed and studied under a microscopic to detect characteristic changes or findings that can aid in obtaining a diagnosis. Imaging studies of the central nervous system (CNS) and comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) array, microarray, and exome studies may also be useful studies in making diagnoses. Because of the many mutations that can lead to arthrogryposis, whole genome sequencing is often required (preferable in both parents for comparison as well) to make a diagnosis.","arthrogryposis multiplex congenita, amyoplasia, AMC",RAREDISEASE
Glycogen-Storage-Disease-Type-VII,"Glycogen storage diseases are a group of disorders in which stored glycogen cannot be metabolized into glucose to supply energy for the body. Glycogen storage disease type VII (GSD VII) is characterized by weakness, pain and stiffness during exercise.  GSD VII is caused by abnormalities in the muscle phosphofructokinase gene that results in a deficiency of the phosphofructokinase enzyme. This enzyme deficiency leads to a reduced amount of energy available to muscles during exercise.  GSD VII is inherited as an autosomal recessive genetic disorder. GSD type VII usually begins in childhood and is characterized by weakness, pain and stiffness during exercise, sometimes associated with nausea and vomiting and dark, burgundy-colored urine due to the presence of myoglobin (myoglobinuria).  Destruction of muscle tissue (rhabdomyolysis) can also occur.  A rare form of GSD type VII has been reported in infants that is associated with progressive loss of muscle tone (hypotonia), muscle weakness and death.  A late-onset form has been reported in adults who experience only muscle weakness. Glycogen storage disease type VII is a rare disorder that occurs more often in individuals of Japanese and Ashkenazi Jewish descent.  GSD type VII affects males and females in equal numbers. GSD type VII is diagnosed by a muscle biopsy for measurement of the phosphofructokinase enzyme level or measurement of the phosphofructokinase enzyme level in red blood cells. Molecular genetic testing for the phosphofructokinase gene mutations prevalent in the Ashkenazi Jewish population are available on a research basis.","GSD type VII, Glycogen storage disease type VII, GSD VII, Glycogen storage diseases",RAREDISEASE
Blepharophimosis-Ptosis-Epicanthus-Inversus-Syndrome,"The four major features that are characteristic symptoms of BPES are present at birth: narrowing of the eye opening (blepharophimosis), droopy eyelids (ptosis), formation of an upward fold of the inner lower eyelid (epicanthus inversus) and increased distance between the eyes (telecanthus). There are two types of BPES, BPES type I and type II, which are both characterized by the typical eyelid malformation. However, BPES type I is also associated with loss of ovarian function or premature ovarian insufficiency (POI). Menstrual periods in women with POI become less frequent over time and stop before the age of 40 thus leading to either difficulty (subfertility) or inability to conceive (infertility).  Other minor facial features frequently observed in both types include “lazy” eye (amblyopia), crossed eyes (strabismus), low-set ears, a short distance between the upper lip and nose, and a broad nasal bridge.

Kearns-Sayre-Syndrome,"Kearns-Sayre syndrome (KSS) is a rare neuromuscular disorder.  An important clinical symptomatic feature is the presence of a mono-or bilateral ptosis (partial closure of the eyelids). This disease is mostly characterized by three primary findings: progressive paralysis of certain eye muscles (chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia [CPEO]); abnormal accumulation of colored (pigmented) material on the nerve-rich membrane lining the eyes (atypical retinitis pigmentosa), leading to chronic inflammation, progressive degeneration, and wearing-away of certain eye structures (pigmentary degeneration of the retina); and heart disease (cardiomyopathy) such as heart block. Other findings may include muscle weakness, short stature, hearing loss, and/or the loss of ability to coordinate voluntary movements (ataxia) due to problems affecting part of the brain (cerebellum). In some cases, KSS may be associated with other disorders and/or conditions.","Kearns-Sayre syndrome, KSS, atypical retinitis pigmentosa, CPEO, chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia",RAREDISEASE

Rapid,"Rapid-onset obesity with hypothalamic dysfunction, hypoventilation, and autonomic dysregulation (ROHHAD) is a rare disorder of respiratory control and autonomic nervous system (ANS) regulation, with endocrine system abnormalities. Respiratory control is the automatic function of breathing in response to varied activities of daily living (ex. exercise, sleep, eating), so within the context of the ANS. The ANS is the portion of the nervous system that controls or regulates many involuntary body functions including heart rate, blood pressure, temperature regulation, bowel and bladder control, breathing, and more. The endocrine system is regulated by the hypothalamus, and through hormones it controls growth, energy and water balance, sexual maturation and fertility as well as response to stress. The diagnosis of ROHHAD is currently based on clinical criteria and though investigation of genetic mutations is underway, no specific cause for ROHHAD has been found to date. ROHHAD is a very rare disorder with approximately 100 cases reported in the literature and clinically to date. Though first described under a different name in 1965, it was not re-named until 2007 nor shown to be distinct from CCHS (documented absence of CCHS-related PHOX2B mutations). Therefore, as ROHHAD is a relatively “new” disorder without many cases identified thus far, it is not yet clear if any certain population is at greater risk for developing ROHHAD.  Because of the explosion of exogenous obesity worldwide, a very high level of vigilance in consideration of ROHHAD is essential. Congenital central hypoventilation syndrome (CCHS) is a disorder of the ANS caused by a gene mutation in the PHOX2B gene that affects the embryologic development of the ANS. Similar to ROHHAD, the “automatic” control of breathing, heart -beat, digestion, and other features of ANSD are among the affected features. In CCHS, the hallmark is hypoventilation while sleeping and, in severe cases, hypoventilation while awake and asleep – despite anatomically normal heart, lung, and airways. Both CCHS and ROHHAD fall within the rubric of respiratory and autonomic disorders of infancy, childhood, and adulthood (RADICA). CCHS is a rare disorder with approximately 1,000 cases described worldwide.  Numbers of reported CCHS cases continue to grow, likely because of increased awareness and introduction of a clinically available genetic test (in 2003) – allowing for early diagnosis and improved treatment. CCHS is often diagnosed in the newborn period because of breathing problems, but milder forms of CCHS may go undiagnosed through infancy, childhood, and even adulthood. A simple blood test can be done to look for a PHOX2B gene mutation (PHOX2B is the disease-defining gene for CCHS). Different types of mutations can occur in this gene which will determine how severely an individual with CCHS is affected. Stepwise testing for PHOX2B mutations should be done with close involvement by a physician and genetic counselor.

Chromosome-7-Partial-Monosomy-7p,"Chromosome 7, Partial Monosomy 7p is a rare chromosomal disorder characterized by deletion (monosomy) of a portion of the short arm (p) of chromosome 7 (7p). Associated symptoms and findings may be variable and may depend on the specific size and location of the deleted segment of 7p. However, in many cases, there is early closure of the fibrous joints (cranial sutures) between certain bones of the skull (craniosynostosis), resulting in an abnormally shaped head. For example, depending on the specific sutures involved, the forehead may appear unusually ""triangular shaped"" (trigonocephaly) or the head may seem abnormally long and narrow with the top pointed or conical (turricephaly). Affected infants and children may also have additional malformations of the skull and facial (craniofacial) region. Such abnormalities may include an unusually small head (microcephaly), closely or widely set eyes (ocular hypotelorism or hypertelorism), downslanting eyelid folds (palpebral fissures), and/or other findings. Chromosome 7, Partial Monosomy 7p is a rare chromosomal disorder that appears to affect males and females in relatively equal numbers.  More than 30 cases have been reported in the medical literature. Additional chromosomal disorders may be characterized by symptoms and findings similar to those associated with Chromosome 7, Partial Monosomy 7p.  Chromosomal testing is necessary to confirm the specific chromosomal abnormality present.

Hemophagocytic-Lymphohistiocytosis,"Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is a rare, life-threatening condition caused by an overactive, abnormal response of the immune system. The immune system is the body’s natural defense system against foreign or invading organisms or substances. The immune system is a complex network of cells, tissues, organs, and proteins that work together to keep the body healthy. In hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, the immune system responds to a stimulus or ‘trigger’, often an infection, but the response is ineffective and abnormal. This ineffective, abnormal response, causes a variety of signs and symptoms, which, if not treated, can potentially become life-threatening. Some affected individuals may have a genetic predisposition to developing hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. This is known as the primary or familial form. In other individuals, the disorder occurs sporadically usually when there is an underlying predisposing condition or disorder. This is known as the secondary form. The secondary forms are more common than the familial forms. Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis most often affects infants from birth to 18 months, but can affect individuals of any age. Early diagnosis and prompt treatment is essential. Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis most often affects infants or young children, but can affect individuals of any age. It affects boys and girls in equal numbers. In adults, it affects men slightly more often than women. The exact incidence and prevalence is unknown. Rare disorders often go misdiagnosed or undiagnosed making it difficult to determine the true frequency in the general population. About 25% of the people with this disorder, have the familial form.","HLH, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis",RAREDISEASE
Osteosarcoma,"Osteosarcoma is a form of cancer. It is a type of tumor that affects the bones. Osteosarcoma can affect people at any age, but is most common during the teen-aged years, and is the most common bone cancer affecting children and adolescents under the age of 20. The long bones of the legs, usually near where they connect to the knees, and the upper long bone of the arms, near where this bone meets the shoulders are the most common sites for osteosarcoma formation. Symptoms will vary depending upon the exact location and extent of disease. Pain is the most common symptom of osteosarcoma and there is often a mass or bump that can be felt (palpable). Eighty percent of individuals present with localized disease, which means the cancer remains in the area it first developed. Osteosarcoma can spread (metastasize) to other areas of the body, most likely the lungs. The exact cause is unknown in most individuals, but osteosarcoma can be induced by radiation. Most individuals are treated with a combination of chemotherapy and surgery. Sometimes, radiation therapy may be used. There are estimated to be about 750-1,000 new individuals diagnosed with osteosarcoma each year in the United States. About 450 of those are children or adolescents under the age of 20. Osteosarcoma is a rare disorder, but it is the most common cause of bone cancer in children and adolescents. These tumors usually affect individuals in their second decade of life (10-19 years of age), most often between 13 and 16 years of age, which most likely coincides with adolescent growth spurts. There is a second increase in the number of people with osteosarcoma in people over the age of 60. Overall, osteosarcoma accounts for about 1% of all cancers diagnosed each year in the United States. Osteosarcoma affect slightly more males than females and is slightly more common in African-Americans and Hispanics/Latinos than in Caucasians.","Osteosarcoma, osteosarcoma",RAREDISEASE

GSD-IX types A, B and C are estimated to affect 1 in 100,000 individuals in the general population. These disorders account for approximately 25% of all glycogen storage disorders making GSD-IX one of the most common forms of these disorders. Because some affected individuals go undiagnosed or misdiagnosed, it is difficult to determine the true frequency of GSD-IX in the general population.

X-linked-Lymphoproliferative-Syndrome,"X-linked lymphoproliferative (XLP) syndrome is an extremely rare inherited (primary) immunodeficiency disorder characterized by a defective immune system that is powerfully responsive to infection with the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). This virus is common among the general population and is relatively well-known because it is the cause of infectious mononucleosis (IM), usually with no long-lasting effects. However, in individuals with XLP, exposure to EBV may result in severe, life-threatening fulminant hepatitis; abnormally low levels of antibodies in the blood and body secretions (hypogammaglobulinemia), resulting in increased susceptibility to various infections; malignancies of certain types of lymphoid tissue (B-cell lymphomas); and/or other abnormalities. The range of symptoms and findings associated with XLP may vary considerably from case to case. In addition, the range of effects may change in an affected individual over time. In most cases, individuals with XLP experience an onset of symptoms anytime from ages about 6 months to 10 years of age. X-linked lymphoproliferative syndrome is an extremely rare disorder that is usually fully expressed in males only.  About 400± cases affecting males in more than 80 multigenerational families (kindreds) from several different countries have been reported in the medical literature.  Researchers estimate that approximately one to two in every one million males are affected by XLP.","XLP, X-linked lymphoproliferative syndrome",RAREDISEASE
Acute-Disseminated-Encephalomyelitis,"ADEM can develop at any age, but is much more frequent in children than adults. Males and females are affected in equal numbers, although a slight male preponderance was seen in a couple pediatric studies. In children, the mean at presentation is between 5-8 years old. The exact incidence of ADEM in the general population is unknown. One study conducted in San Diego, California estimated the incidence of ADEM in persons under 20 years of age at .4 per 100,000. ADEM seems to peak in the winter and spring months in studies conducted in the United States. A diagnosis of ADEM is made based upon identification of characteristic symptoms, a detailed patient history, a thorough clinical evaluation and a variety of specialized tests including imaging techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). An MRI uses a magnetic field and radio waves to produce cross-sectional images of particular organs and bodily tissues and can demonstrate characteristic brain lesions in individuals with ADEM. Additional tests to exclude other conditions may also be performed. Such tests may include infectious, immunologic, and metabolic tests.",ADEM,RAREDISEASE
Renal-Cell-Carcinoma,"Renal cell carcinoma is a form of kidney cancer. Some patients with renal cell carcinoma do not have symptoms (asymptomatic). When symptoms are present, they may include blood in the urine; urine that is brown or rusty-colored; abdominal pain; weight loss; enlargement of one testicle or varicose veins of the testis (varicocele) in a male patient; fever; a thin, malnourished appearance; vision abnormalities; and elevated blood pressure. The most common feature of the syndrome is the passing of blood in the urine (hematuria). Renal cell carcinoma is more common in males than in females (ratio of 2 or 3 to 1) and in persons with a history of smoking.  It is also more common in persons with other types of kidney disorders and tends to run in some families.  Renal cell carcinoma accounts for approximately 30,000 new cases of kidney malignancies per year in the United States. Imaging studies, typically computerized tomography (CT) and abdominal ultrasonography (USG), are used in the diagnosis of renal cell carcinoma. Blood and urine testing may also be helpful.","Renal cell carcinoma, renal cell carcinoma",RAREDISEASE

Dextrocardia-with-Situs-Inversus,"Dextrocardia with Situs Inversus is a rare heart condition characterized by abnormal positioning of the heart. In this condition, the tip of the heart (apex) is positioned on the right side of the chest. Additionally, the position of the heart chambers as well as the visceral organs such as the liver and spleen is reversed (situs inversus). However, most affected individuals can live a normal life without associated symptoms or disability. Electrocardiography reveals an inversion of the electrical waves from the heart and is the diagnostic measure of choice. Dextrocardia with Situs Inversus is present at birth.  The condition affects males and females in equal numbers. Treatment of Dextrocardia with Situs Inversus is symptomatic and supportive when needed. In most cases, affected individuals can live a normal life without any symptoms or discomfort. If the condition is associated with other more serious heart malformations, the prognosis and treatment will vary. Genetic counseling may be helpful for affected families.","situs inversus, Dextrocardia with Situs Inversus",RAREDISEASE
Appendiceal-Cancer-and-Tumors,"Appendiceal cancer is very rare with approximately 1-2 cases per 1 million individuals. Appendiceal cancers can occur at any age, with the peak occurrence in the 6th decade (average age of 50 at diagnosis). Most studies report that men and women are affected in equal numbers, while a few have suggested a slightly increased frequency in women. Peritoneal carcinomatosis is the spread and growth of cancer cells in the abdominal cavity. Cancers that are most frequently associated with peritoneal carcinomatosis include the gastrointestinal (colon, rectal, appendiceal, gastric, pancreas, small bowel and gallbladder) and the gynecologic (ovarian, primary peritoneal, and uterine) cancers. Other cancers that can spread to the abdominal cavity include breast, esophagus, and melanoma. Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) are a subtype of sarcoma of the intestine that can also present with multiple cancer tumors in the abdomen. Peritoneal mesothelioma is a cancer that originates in the lining of the abdominal cavity (peritoneum) and presents with signs and symptoms of peritoneal carcinomatosis. Because there are no unique features of appendiceal cancer on imaging studies such as ultrasound, CT scan, PET scan or MRI, the actual diagnosis of appendiceal cancer cannot be made until a tumor specimen is examined by a pathologist. This is frequently accomplished at the time of appendectomy for appendicitis, surgery for an intestinal blockage or presumed ovarian cancer, or through a diagnostic tumor biopsy performed for an abnormal clinical or radiographic finding such as a palpable tumor or tumors seen on an imaging study. The finding of a dilated, mucin filled appendix on CT scan or MRI should prompt concern for an appendiceal tumor and an appendectomy should be considered. The different types of appendiceal tumors and cancers can be distinguished by the appearance of the cells under the microscope and by staining them for specific markers. Goblet cell carcinoid tumors tend to be easier to identify because of the unique combination of neuroendocrine and epithelial cells.","ovarian cancer, Gastrointestinal stromal tumors, sarcoma of the intestine, Appendiceal cancer, Peritoneal mesothelioma, ppendiceal tumor, Goblet cell carcinoid, appendiceal cancer, appendiceal tumors, Appendiceal cancers, GISTs",RAREDISEASE
OSMED-Heterozygous,"Heterozygous OSMED (oto-spondyl-megaepiphyseal dysplasia) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by skeletal malformations resulting in shortening of the upper limbs and thighs and short stature (rhizomelic dwarfism). Additional symptoms include distinctive facial features and delays in psychomotor development. After the initial period of growth deficiency, affected individuals experience gradual improvement in bone growth that leads to normal physical development by early childhood. Mental and motor development is also normal by early childhood. In some cases, affected individuals develop hearing loss. Heterozygous OSMED occurs because of disruptions or changes (mutations) to the COL11A2 gene. A diagnosis of heterozygous OSMED is made based upon a thorough clinical evaluation, a detailed patient history, identification of characteristic symptoms, and a variety of specialized tests including x-rays. X-ray studies reveal characteristic skeletal malformations associated with heterozygous OSMED.","heterozygous OSMED, Heterozygous OSMED, oto-spondyl-megaepiphyseal dysplasia",RAREDISEASE
Holoprosencephaly,"Holoprosencephaly (HPE) is the failure of the prosencephalon, or forebrain, to develop normally. The forebrain is a region of the brain in the fetus that develops into parts of the adult brain, including the cerebral cortex. Instead of the normal complete separation of the left and right halves of the forebrain, there is an abnormal continuity between the two sides. There are several different types of holoprosencephaly. In the alobar form, there is no separation between the right and left halves at all. In semilobar HPE, at least some separation of the two halves is present. In the lobar form, most of the brain has separated into right and left sides, though there is incomplete division into the two halves. Holoprosencephaly affects males and females in equal numbers before birth and has been reported in many ethnic groups. The incidence of holoprosencephaly has been estimated at 1 in 250 during early embryonic development, and approximately 1 in 16,000 live births.","Holoprosencephaly, HPE, HPE lobar, alobar HPE, semilobar HPE, holoprosencephaly",RAREDISEASE
Acidemia-Isovaleric,"Isovaleric Acidemia is a hereditary metabolic disorder. It is characterized by a deficiency of the enzyme isovaleryl CoA dehydrogenase. The disorder occurs in both an acute and a chronic intermittent form. In the acute form of Isovaleric Acidemia, vomiting, refusal to eat, and listlessness usually occur. With treatment and low protein diet, the disorder becomes chronically intermittent, and a nearly normal life is possible. Isovaleric Acidemia is a genetic disorder inherited through autosomal  recessive genes.  Symptoms are the result of a deficiency of the enzyme  isovaleric co-enzyme A (CoA) dehydrogenase, which is needed for the breakdown  of the amino acid leucine.  Human traits, including the classic genetic diseases, are the product of the interaction of two genes for that condition, one received from the father and one from the mother.  In recessive disorders, the condition does not appear unless a person inherits the same defective gene for the same trait from each parent.  If an individual receives one normal gene and one gene for the disease, the person will be a carrier for the disease, but generally will not show symptoms of the disorder. The risk of  transmitting the disease to the children of a couple, both of whom are carriers for a recessive disorder, is 25 percent.  On average, fifty percent of their children will be carriers of the disease, while 25 percent will receive a normal copy of the gene from each parent for that trait.  The risks are the same for each pregnancy. Isovaleric Acidemia is a rare disorder affecting males and females in equal numbers, usually beginning during infancy.",Isovaleric Acidemia,RAREDISEASE
Multiple-System-Atrophy,"MSA appears to affect males and females in equal numbers. The peak onset of MSA is between 55-60 years of age, with a range from 30 to over 90 years. The incidence of MSA in the United States is estimated at 0.6 cases per 100,000 people per year in the general population giving a current estimate of about 1,900 new cases per year in the USA. A prevalence study in London, UK, gave an age-adjusted figure of 4.4 living cases per 100,000 population at any one time, which would currently translate to about 14,000 living cases in the USA. There is about 1 living case of MSA in the population for every 40 cases of Parkinson’s disease, but because survival in MSA is shorter than for PD, about 1 new MSA case presents every year for about every 20 who present with PD.","MSA, PD, Parkinson’s disease",RAREDISEASE
Hyperostosis-Frontalis-Interna,"Hyperostosis Frontalis Interna is characterized by the thickening of the frontal bone of the skull. It is not clear that this disorder is actually rare.

Trisomy-18-Syndrome,"Trisomy 18 syndrome is a rare chromosomal disorder in which all or a critical region of chromosome 18 appears three times (trisomy) rather than twice in cells of the body. In some cases, the chromosomal abnormality may be present in only a percentage of cells, whereas other cells contain the normal chromosomal pair (mosaicism). Trisomy 18 syndrome was originally known as Edwards syndrome, after one of the investigators (JH Edwards) who initially recognized the condition as a distinct disease entity in 1960.  The syndrome appears to affect females more frequently than males by a ratio of approximately three or four to one. Large population surveys indicate that it occurs in about one in 5,000 to 7,000 live births.  The frequency of trisomy 18 syndrome increases with advancing age of the mother.

Degos-Disease,"Degos disease is an extremely rare disorder in which small and medium sized arteries become blocked (occlusive arteriopathy), restricting the flow of blood to affected areas. Degos disease usually causes characteristic skin lesions that may last for a period of time ranging from weeks to years. In some individuals, Degos disease will be limited to the skin (benign cutaneous Degos disease); other individuals will also develop symptoms affecting other organ systems (systemic Degos disease). Systemic Degos disease is most frequently characterized by lesions in the small intestine, but other organs are also affected. Major symptoms may include abdominal pain, diarrhea, and/or weight loss. The systemic form of Degos disease can cause life-threatening complications such as perforated bowels leading to inflammation of the abdominal cavity (peritonitis). The exact cause of Degos disease is unknown. A diagnosis of Degos disease is made based upon a thorough clinical evaluation, a detailed patient history, identification of characteristic findings (e.g., skin lesions), and microscopic examination of affected skin tissue that reveal distinctive changes to that tissue. Because most tests are normal, no specific laboratory test can be used to aid in the diagnosis of Degos disease.","Degos disease, Systemic Degos disease, systemic Degos disease",RAREDISEASE
Dyskeratosis-Congenita,"Dyskeratosis congenita is a rare genetic form of bone marrow failure, the inability of the marrow to produce sufficient blood cells. Dyskeratosis is Latin and means the irreversible degeneration of skin tissue, and congenita means inborn. First described in the medical literature in 1906, dyskeratosis congenita was originally thought to be a skin disease that also affects the nails and the mouth. Only later in the sixties was it realized that patients with these skin changes almost always develop bone marrow failure. Thus, for the last 40 years or so, the bone marrow failure syndrome dyskeratosis congenita was diagnosed when patients presented with the triad of abnormal skin, malformation (dystrophy) of the nails, and white, thickened patches on the mucous membranes of the mouth (oral leukoplakia). The skin changes may be present before the development of bone marrow failure. Bone marrow failure is usually diagnosed by the low number of circulating blood cells including red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. Additional findings in patients with dyskeratosis congenita may include short stature, eye and tooth abnormalities, thin and early graying of the hair, lung (pulmonary) disease, liver disease, gut abnormalities, bone thinning (osteoporosis), infertility, learning difficulties, and delays in reaching developmental milestones. An increased incidence of leukemia and cancer has also been documented. The prevalence or incidence of dyskeratosis congenita is difficult to assess. In a population of patients with bone marrow failure about 2-5% of patients have bone marrow failure due to dyskeratosis congenita. In patients with pulmonary fibrosis similarly 2-5% are thought to be due to mutations in TERC or TERT. In families with an increased frequency of bone marrow failure and/or lung disease, dyskeratosis congenita should be excluded as a possible cause of their disease.",leukemia,RAREDISEASE
Medullary-Sponge-Kidney,"Medullary Sponge Kidney is a rare disorder characterized by the formation of cystic malformations in the collecting ducts and the tubular structures within the kidneys (tubules) that collect urine. One or both kidneys may be affected. The initial symptoms of this disorder may include blood in the urine (hematuria), calcium stone formation in the kidneys (nephrolithiasis) or infection. The exact cause of Medullary Sponge Kidney is not known. The exact cause of Medullary Sponge Kidney is not known and most cases occur sporadically for no apparent reason.  Some cases are thought to run in families (familial) and may be inherited as an autosomal dominant genetic trait.  However, this inheritance pattern has not been proven.  Some studies have suggested there may be a a possible relationship between overactivity of the parathyroid gland (Hyperparathyroidism) and Medullary Sponge Kidney. Medullary Sponge Kidney is a rare disorder that affects slightly more women than men.  It is thought to occur in 1 in 1,000 to 5,000 people in the United States.  Although the symptoms of Medullary Sponge Kidney may begin at any age, they usually develop during adolescence or in adults between the ages of 30 and 50 years.  Approximately 13 percent of all people who develop kidney stones are eventually diagnosed with Medullary Sponge Kidney.

Hydrocephalus,"Hydrocephalus is a condition in which abnormally widened (dilated) cerebral spaces in the brain (ventricles) inhibit the normal flow of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The cerebrospinal fluid accumulates in the skull and puts pressure on the brain tissue. An enlarged head in infants and increased cerebrospinal fluid pressure are frequent findings but are not necessary for the diagnosis of Hydrocephalus. There are several different forms of Hydrocephalus: communicating hydrocephalus, non-communicating hydrocephalus or obstructive hydrocephalus, internal hydrocephalus, normal pressure hydrocephalus, and benign hydrocephalus. Most cases of Hydrocephalus are diagnosed in the first 2 years of life, but onset may occur at any age, depending on the cause.

Muscular-Dystrophy-Becker,"Becker muscular dystrophy is in the category of inherited muscle wasting diseases caused by a gene abnormality (mutation) that results in deficient or abnormal production of the dystrophin protein (dystrophinopathies). The abnormal gene is called DMD and is located on the X chromosome. Becker muscular dystrophy follows x-linked recessive inheritance so it mostly affects males, but some females are affected. Becker muscular dystrophy usually begins in the teens or early twenties and symptoms vary greatly between affected individuals. Muscle deterioration progresses slowly but usually results in the need for a wheel chair. Muscles of the heart deteriorate (cardiomyopathy) in some affected individuals, and this process can become life-threatening. Learning disabilities involving visual abilities may be present. Becker muscular dystrophy occurs in approximately 1 in 30,000 male births. The diagnosis of Becker muscular dystrophy is based on physical symptoms, family history, an elevated concentration of creatine kinase (CK) in the blood indicating destruction of muscle, and molecular genetic testing. DMD is the only gene that has been associated with Becker muscular dystrophy and many different types of DMD gene mutations have been identified in individuals with this condition. Identification of a DMD gene mutation from molecular genetic testing confirms the diagnosis. If molecular genetic testing is performed and a DMD gene mutation is not found, a skeletal muscle biopsy is recommended to examine the appearance of the dystrophin protein.",Becker muscular dystrophy,RAREDISEASE
Madelung_s-Disease,"The exact cause of Madelung’s disease is not known. The body’s inability to properly metabolize fat indicates that it may be an endocrine disorder. Some scientists believe a predisposition to the disorder may be inherited and there have been some reports of cases that appear to be familial. However, the mode of transmission in those cases has not been determined. Madelung’s disease most frequently affects middle-aged males. The condition is most common in those who abuse alcohol. However, this disease is also found in women and persons who do not consume alcohol. For reasons that are unclear, the disorder appears to be more prevalent in Europe than in the United States. The diagnosis of Madelung’s disease may involve ultrasound images, CAT scans, or magnetic resonance imaging.",Madelung’s disease,RAREDISEASE
CHARGE-Syndrome,"CHARGE syndrome is a rare disorder, affecting 0.1-1.2/10,000 live births. It affects males and females in equal numbers and has been seen in all races and on every continent. There are far more cases of CHARGE than those described in the medical literature. Many cases are misdiagnosed or undiagnosed, especially in children with fewer problems. Although many features of CHARGE are apparent at birth, some features will not become apparent for weeks, months, or perhaps years later. The recurrence risk of CHARGE for parents with one affected child is low, around 2-3 percent. The recurrence risk for an adult with CHARGE to have an affected child may be as high as 50 percent.","CHARGE syndrome, CHARGE",RAREDISEASE
Mesenteric-Panniculitis,"The epidemiology of mesenteric panniculitis has not been fully defined. A recent study reported that findings consistent with mesenteric panniculitis occurred in 359 patients (0.24%) from a total of 147,794 abdominal computed tomography (CT) examinations undertaken for over a 5-year period in a large community based medical system. Of these, 100 patients (28%) had known malignancy or were later diagnosed with cancer. In some reports, mesenteric panniculitis has a male predominance of 2:1. Mesenteric panniculitis most often appears during the sixth and seventh decade of life, and its incidence appears to increase with age. Children and adolescents are less commonly affected, possibly related to a lesser amount of fat in their mesentery, but more importantly because of specific characteristics of this form of autoimmunity. Symptoms of the mesenteric panniculitis mimic those of a number of other benign and malignant conditions. Because of this, it is important to rule out other diseases prior to confirming the diagnosis of mesenteric panniculitis. Infectious causes range from viral, bacterial (including V. cholerae) and parasitic infections. There are also a variety of diseases that are associated with mesenteric abnormalities on abdominal imaging. Such conditions include primary or metastatic mesentery cancer, gastrointestinal lymphoma, desmoid tumors, inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis), Crohn’s disease, idiopathic nodular panniculitis, locally advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma, retroperitoneal fibrosis and other sclerotic diseases as mentioned above.","mesenteric panniculitis, retroperitoneal fibrosis, locally advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma, gastrointestinal lymphoma, Mesenteric panniculitis, Crohn’s disease, primary or metastatic mesentery cancer, idiopathic nodular panniculitis",RAREDISEASE
Kasabach,"Kasabach-Merritt phenomenon (KMP) is a rare condition that is associated with a coagulopathy with features including profound thrombocytopenia (low platelets), hypofibrinogenemia (low fibrinogen), and anemia. This phenomenon is only associated  with two rare vascular tumors: kaposiform hemangioendotheliomas and tufted angiomas.  This condition can be life threatening secondary to the risk of bleeding and progression to DIC (disseminated intravascular coagulopathy). Initially a vascular lesion is noted on the skin which can be firm, indurated and purpuric.  Areas of petechiae (tiny red dots) can appear around the lesion or on other parts of the body.  If the vascular lesion is internal, these petechiae can be seen on the skin.  Bruising and spontaneous bleeding can also occur.  These tumors are not hemangiomas.  They usually present in young infants, less than three months of age, but have rarely been reported in older children.  These tumors occur in the extremities, chest, neck, abdomen and pelvis.  They infiltrate across tissue plans and can be aggravated by interventions, infection and trauma.  When these tumors with KMP are internal such as in the pleural or retroperitoneum, they can cause significant morbidity and mortality.  The morbidity and mortality is caused by bleeding. The cause of Kasabach-Merritt phenomenon is unknown. It is believed to be secondary to sequestration or trapping of platelets into the tumor.  These tumors are made up of abnormal endothelial cells (spindle cells) and also lymphatic malformation.  It is unclear why the KMP occurs and if it is caused by the spindle cells or the lymphatic component. Kasabach-Merritt phenomenon is a rare disorder that affects males and females equally The diagnosis is most often made during infancy but older children have been reported with this phenomenon.  KHE and TA tumors can occur without KMP.  The reason for this is still unknown and may be secondary to a smaller size of the tumor, an older age at presentation or other clinical features. The diagnosis of Kasabach-Merritt phenomenon is based on the diagnosis of Kaposiform hemangioendothelioma/tufted angioma and this coagulopathy as noted above.  If this diagnosis is suspected blood work including a CBC with differential and platelets, fibrinogen, D-dimer, PT, and PTT should be ordered. The best imaging modality to assess the extent of the lesion is a MRI with contrast. A biopsy will confirm the diagnosis.","TA, kaposiform hemangioendotheliomas, Kasabach-Merritt phenomenon, Kaposiform hemangioendothelioma, tufted angioma, tufted angiomas, KMP, KHE",RAREDISEASE
Leber-Hereditary-Optic-Neuropathy,"Leber hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON) is mainly characterized by bilateral, painless subacute loss of central vision during young adult life. In most cases, symptoms begin with one eye first, followed a few weeks later by visual failure in the other eye. Extremely rarely there may be neurologic abnormalities, such as peripheral neuropathy, postural tremor, nonspecific myopathy, and movement disorders. LHON is caused by mutations in mitochondrial DNA and it is transmitted by maternal inheritance. LHON affects approximately 1:50,000 people. Many carriers never suffer significant visual loss; males are about four to five times more likely than females to be affected. LHON affects both males and females and can only be inherited from a female. The birth prevalence of LHON is approximately 1 in 50,000 people. LHON is diagnosed based on ophthalmologic findings, which include specialized visual testing. The testing involves dilated fundus examination to identify characteristic changes in the optic disc and vascular changes during the acute phase, electrophysiologic studies, and neuroimaging. Molecular genetic testing for mitochondrial genes associated with LHON can be used to confirm diagnosis. Most affected individuals know if their family members also are affected by LHON.","Leber hereditary optic neuropathy, LHON",RAREDISEASE
Congenital-Syphilis,"Congenital syphilis is a chronic infectious disease caused by the spirochete treponema pallidum and transmitted by an infected mother to the fetus in the womb. Adults transmit syphilis through sexual contact. (For information on syphilis in adults choose “Syphilis” as your search term in the Rare Disease Database). In 1998, the National Syphilis Elimination Plan went into effect. One of the goals of this plan was to reduce the incidence of congenital syphilis (CS) to fewer than 40 cases per 100,000 live births. The incidence of congenital syphilis in newborns under a year old rose in the United States from 180 cases in 1957 to 422 cases in 1972. More recently there has been a dramatic increase of congenital syphilis, especially in urban areas, that has been attributed in part to crack cocaine use. In the year 2000, the incidence rate was about 13.4 per 100,000 live births, which represented about 529 cases. The diagnosis of CS may be delayed because the symptoms are not always evident. However, any child of a mother infected with syphilis should be suspected for congenital syphilis. If the signs and symptoms are not obviously those of CS, then further testing will be required, including (1) the examination of blood samples for antibodies to the spirochete infection and (2) identification of the syphilis bacterium under a light microscope.","CS, Syphilis, syphilis, Congenital syphilis, congenital syphilis",RAREDISEASE
NGLY1-Deficiency,"NGLY1 NGLY1 deficiency is an extremely rare disorder that was first reported in the medical literature in 2012. According to the NGLY1 Foundation, as of January 2018, there are approximately 63 individuals worldwide who have been identified with the disorder. Rare diseases like NGLY1 deficiency often go undiagnosed or misdiagnosed, making it difficult to determine the true frequency in the general population.",NGLY1 deficiency,RAREDISEASE
Dandy-Walker-Malformation,"Dandy-Walker malformation (DWM) is a brain malformation that occurs during embryonic development of the cerebellum and 4th ventricle. The cerebellum is the area of the brain that helps coordinate movement, and is also involved with cognition and behavior. The 4th ventricle is a space around the cerebellum that channels fluid from inside to around the outside of the brain. DWM is characterized by underdevelopment (small size and abnormal position) of the middle part of the cerebellum known as the cerebellar vermis, cystic enlargement of the 4th ventricle and enlargement of the base of the skull (posterior fossa). DWM is sometimes (20-80%) associated with hydrocephalus, in which blockage of the normal flow of spinal fluid leads to excessive amounts of fluid accumulating in and around the brain. This leads to abnormally high pressure within the skull and swelling of the head, and can lead to neurological impairment. DWM results from defects in early embryonic development of the cerebellum and surrounding structures.  A few patients have chromosome abnormalities including deletion of chromosome 3q24.3 (the location of the first DWM genes, known as ZIC1 and ZIC4), 6p25 or 13q32.2-q33.2, or duplication of 9p.  In the remainder, it is probably due to other more complex genetic and perhaps environmental factors (teratogens) as the recurrence risk in siblings less than 5%.  A few examples of affected siblings with isolated Dandy-Walker malformation have been reported, suggesting autosomal recessive or X-linked inheritance, but most of these are probably CVH and not typical DWM.  In these families, the recurrence risk is higher, up to 25%.  DWM may also occur as part of a genetic syndrome that includes multiple birth defects, such as the PHACES syndrome of facial hemangioma, heart and sternal defects and DWM.  Many other syndromes and chromosome abnormalities have been reported with DWM, but most of these appear to have CVH rather than typical DWM. The frequency of Dandy Walker malformation in the US is approximately 1 per 25,000 -35,000 live births and affects more females than males. Dandy Walker malformation is diagnosed with the use of ultrasound, CT and MRI. Prenatal diagnosis of Dandy-Walker malformation is sometimes made by ultrasound or fetal MRI.","DWM, isolated Dandy-Walker malformation, PHACES syndrome of facial hemangioma, Dandy-Walker malformation, Dandy Walker malformation, CVH",RAREDISEASE
X,"X-linked myopathy with excessive autophagy (XMEA) is an extremely rare genetic disorder characterized by muscle disease (myopathy). The disorder is fully expressed in males only and is characterized by slowly progressive muscle weakness, especially in the legs. Onset is usually during childhood often between 5-10 years of age. XMEA occurs due to mutations of an unidentified gene on the X chromosome. The disorder is inherited an X-linked recessive trait. A diagnosis of XMEA is made based upon a thorough clinical evaluation, a detailed patient history and surgical removal and microscopic evaluation (biopsy) of affected muscle tissue.","XMEA, X-linked myopathy with excessive autophagy",RAREDISEASE
Amelogenesis-Imperfecta,"Amelogenesis imperfecta (AI) refers to a group of rare, inherited disorders characterized by abnormal enamel formation. The term is typically restricted to those disorders of enamel development not associated with other abnormalities of the body. AI affects 1 of 14,000 to 16,000 children in the United States. Of this number, about 40% have the hypocalcified dominant type. The autosomal dominant and recessive forms of the disorder affect males and females in equal numbers. The X-linked dominant type of the disorder affects twice as many males as females. The X-linked recessive type affects only males. Diagnosis of AI is usually made by visual examination, family history and X-ray examination at the time teeth erupt. The dentist may use a simple hand instrument to distinguish the different types of AI. By one to two years of age, the diagnosis can be made.","AI, Amelogenesis imperfecta",RAREDISEASE
Froelich-Syndrome,"Froehlich syndrome, also known as adiposogenital dystrophy, is a constellation of endocrine abnormalities believed to result from damage to the hypothalamus, a part of the brain that links the nervous system to the endocrine system via the pituitary gland.  The hypothalamus regulates sleep cycles and body temperature and composition while stimulating the pituitary gland to release a variety of hormones that control growth, metabolism, and body development. Thus, numerous pituitary gland hormones could be indirectly disrupted by damage to the hypothalamus. Unlike similar diseases such as Prader-Willi syndrome, Froehlich syndrome is acquired, not inherited, and is associated with tumors of the hypothalamus area or their surgical treatment, causing increased appetite and depressed secretion of gonadotropin. This syndrome affects males more often than females. Froehlich syndrome is characterized by increased or excessive eating that leads to obesity, small testes, and a delay in the onset of puberty. It is also common for children with Froehlich syndrome to experience the delay in physical growth and the development of secondary sexual characteristics. In addition to delayed growth and puberty, children with this syndrome tend to be short in stature. As a result of tumor growth, some children with Froehlich syndrome may also develop intellectual difficulties, poor vision – due optic nerve damage-, somnolence, and diabetes insipidus –  known as Infundibulo-tuberal syndrome (Froehlich+somnolence+diabetes insipidus), lower than normal body temperature (hypothermia) and very delicate skin. Froehlich syndrome is a very rare condition that affects more males than females.","Froehlich syndrome, Froehlich+somnolence+diabetes insipidus, Prader-Willi syndrome, Infundibulo-tuberal syndrome, adiposogenital dystrophy",RAREDISEASE
Hyperprolinemia-Type-I,"Two types of hyperprolinemia are recognized by physicians and clinical researchers. Each represents an inherited inborn error of metabolism involving the amino acid, proline. Proline is abundant in nature and readily found in a variety of foods. Hyperprolinemia Type I is the result of proline oxidase deficiency and is characterized by an abnormally high proline blood level.  Levels of the amino acids hydroxyproline and glycine in the blood are also higher than normal.  Some clinicians believe that kidney abnormalities may be associated with HP-I, although this is disputed.  The signs and symptoms of HP-I, other than the high levels of amino acids in the blood and urine, are vague.  Often, this disorder is described as benign. Hyperprolinemia Type I is a very rare disorder that is present at birth.  It affects males and females in equal numbers. HP-I is recognized by elevated blood proline levels. (The normal level is approximately 450 units, but people with HP-1 may have levels of 1900 to 2000 units.. Often, the diagnosis is made by exclusion. After failure to arrive at a diagnosis by other means, a blood proline level is ordered. The result confirms the diagnosis.","HP-1, hyperprolinemia, proline oxidase deficiency, Hyperprolinemia Type I, HP-I",RAREDISEASE
Tardive-Dyskinesia,"Tardive dyskinesia is characterized by involuntary and abnormal movements of the jaw, lips and tongue. Typical symptoms include facial grimacing, sticking out the tongue, sucking or fish-like movements of the mouth. In some cases, the arms and/or legs may also be affected by involuntary rapid, jerking movements (chorea), or slow, writhing movements (athetosis). Symptoms of tardive dystonia include slower, twisting movements of larger muscles of the neck and trunk as well as the face. Tardive dyskinesia is caused by long-term use of a class of drugs known as neuroleptics. Neuroleptic drugs are often prescribed for management of certain mental, neurological, or gastrointestinal disorders. Metoclopramide and prochlorperazine are drugs used for chronic gastrointestinal conditions that may cause tardive dyskinesia. Neuroleptic drugs block dopamine receptors in the brain. Dopamine is a neurotransmitter which is a chemical that helps brain cells to communicate. Although most cases occur after a person has taken these drugs for several years, some cases may occur with shorter use of neuroleptic drugs. Tardive dyskinesia affects individuals who have been taking neuroleptic drugs for a long period of time. A high percentage of schizophrenic people who have spent long periods of time taking these drugs have a high risk of developing TD. However, neuroleptic drugs are also prescribed for depression, some digestive disorders, and other neurologic illnesses.","TD, Tardive dyskinesia, tardive dyskinesia, tardive dystonia",RAREDISEASE

The prevalence, which is the number of people with a disorder at a given time, is not known, but estimated to be somewhere between 1 in 200 to 1 in 800 people in the general population. In certain populations, the prevalence is higher. In individuals of Ashkenazi Jewish descent, HBOC syndrome affects about 1 in 40 people. Sometimes, this is due to a founder effect.

It is estimated that approximately 1 percent of people who have venous thrombosis and embolism have congenital antithrombin deficiency. The acquired form of antithrombin deficiency is more prevalent than the congenital form of the disorder. A low blood level of antithrombin suggests that the patient may have antithrombin deficiency. However, it is important to keep in mind that many conditions can lower antithrombin levels (acute clots, heparin therapy, liver or kidney disease, etc.) without the patient having inherited antithrombin deficiency. Repeat testing should be done at a time when the patient is not ill, is not on heparin and does not have related medical problems.","antithrombin deficiency, inherited antithrombin deficiency, Type I antithrombin deficiency, congenital antithrombin deficiency, Antithrombin deficiency, acquired antithrombin deficiency",RAREDISEASE
Congenital-Pulmonary-Lymphangiectasia,"Congenital pulmonary lymphangiectasia (CPL) is a rare developmental disorder that is present at birth (congenital). Affected infants have abnormally widened (dilated) lymphatic vessels within the lungs. The lymphatic system helps the immune system in protecting the body against infection and disease. It consists of a network of tubular channels (lymph vessels) that drain a thin watery fluid known as lymph from different areas of the body into the bloodstream. Lymph accumulates in the tiny spaces between tissue cells and contains proteins, fats, and certain white blood cells known as lymphocytes. According to some reports CPL occurs more often in males than females. However, the data is not conclusive and CPL may occur in males and females in equal numbers. The exact number of cases of CPL is unknown. In the past, the disorder was associated with high mortality in the newborn period. CPL was first described in the medical literature in 1856.","Congenital pulmonary lymphangiectasia, CPL",RAREDISEASE

Chordoma,"Chordomas can affect individuals of any age, including young children, but most often are diagnosed in individuals between 40-75 years of age (the average age at diagnosis is 55 years). Collectively, chordomas affect males more often than females by a ratio of approximately 2:1. However, skull base tumors have an equal (1:1) gender distribution. Children are more likely to have skull base tumors. Chordomas account for approximately 1-4% of all malignant bone tumors and around 20% of primary tumors of the spinal column. The incidence of chordoma is estimated to be approximately 1 per 1,000,000 people. About 300 new cases of chordoma are diagnosed in the United States each year. Some reports state that these tumors are more common in individuals of European ancestry. Chondrosarcoma is a general term for a type of bone cancer that arises from cartilage cells. Cartilage is the specialized tissue that serves as a buffer or cushion at joints. Most of the skeleton of an embryo consists of cartilage, which is slowly converted into bone. Chondrosarcomas typically affect the arms, legs, and pelvis, but can affect any area that contains cartilage including the skull base and spinal column. Most cases are diagnosed in adults between the ages of 20 and 60. Chondrosarcomas are malignant and may spread to other areas of the body.

Hiccups-Chronic,"A hiccup is an involuntary spasmodic contraction of the muscle at the base of the lungs (diaphragm) followed by the rapid closure of the vocal cords. Usually, hiccups last for a few hours or, occasionally, a day or two. However, chronic hiccups are ones that continue for an extended period of time. Episodes that last for more than two days and less than a month are sometimes called persistent hiccups. On rare occasions, hiccups persist even longer than a month or recur frequently over an extended period of time. The longest recorded episode of these chronic hiccups lasted 60 years. Hiccups are unmistakable, and rarely taken for anything else.  They often start for no apparent reason, and usually go away on their own in a few minutes.  Of concern is the period of time required for an episode to run its course.   Hiccups that persist over a period of time may cause exhaustion and weight loss from lack of sleep and the interruption of normal eating patterns. Hiccups affect males more often than females.  Hiccups occur in practically every human being, but chronic hiccups are very rare. There are many disorders involving the autonomic nervous system which controls unconscious activities of the body such as breathing, sweating, heartbeat, hiccups, coughing, etc. The diagnosis of chronic hiccups may be obvious, but blood, imaging, and other laboratory studies may be used to determine the underlying cause.",chronic hiccups,RAREDISEASE
Mal-de-Debarquement,"The true cause behind MDD is still unknown.  MDD likely results from the body’s balance system inadequately processing and adapting to multiple sensory inputs (visual, vestibular, proprioceptive and cognitive) from the environment once the stimulus (trigger) has ended.  It is as yet undetermined as to the cause of the balance system’s inability to appropriately compensate and adapt. How or why this happens remains a mystery. The majority of people affected are adult females, although there have been reports of males having the diagnosis. Patients with migraine may have any increased susceptibility through unknown mechanisms. The diagnosis of MDD still remains mostly clinical. As such, the history is very important. Persistent “dizziness” after an ocean cruise, a sailing trip, a prolonged airplane flight or a cross-country road trip is highly suggestive of MDD. Vestibular function tests in patients with MDD have been normal or nonspecific in their abnormality. These tests are important in excluding other etiologies for the patient’s symptoms.",MDD,RAREDISEASE
Sheehan-Syndrome,"Excessive blood loss during or after delivery of a baby may affect the function of the pituitary gland, leading to a form of maternal hypopituitarism known as Sheehan syndrome (SS). Such extensive bleeding may reduce the blood flow to the pituitary gland causing the pituitary cells to be damaged or die (necrosis). Thus, the production of the usual pituitary hormones will be reduced, perhaps by a significant amount. During pregnancy the pituitary gland will enlarge and may double in size. At this time the gland is especially vulnerable to a severe drop in blood pressure (sometimes called ""shock"") and excessive maternal bleeding may induce the ""shock"" and the damage to the cells of the gland. At that time the amount of hormones produced by the pituitary may be decreased giving rise to the symptoms associated with hypopituitarism. There appear to be two forms of the disorder; a chronic form and an acute form, depending on the amount of damage to the gland's cells. The acute form reflects considerable damage so that symptoms become apparent soon after delivery. In chronic cases, the volume of damage is much less and symptoms may not appear for months or years after delivery. Sheehan syndrome affects women with excessive blood loss and circulatory collapse following childbirth. The incidence of Sheehan syndrome is not known. In patients with severe hemorrhaging on delivery accompanied by long-lasting low blood pressure, treatment is started as soon as possible. Women believed to have the chronic form usually have blood drawn and the levels for several hormones are determined.","SS, Sheehan syndrome, maternal hypopituitarism",RAREDISEASE
Trisomy-X,"Trisomy X is a chromosomal disorder that affects only females. Reported estimates of frequency have varied with the most common estimate being one in 1,000 female births.

People with GAMT may have weak muscle tone and delayed development of motor skills such as sitting or walking. Severely affected patients may lose previously acquired skills such as the ability to support their head or to sit unsupported. The prevalence of GAMT deficiency has been estimated to be from 1 out of 2,640,000 to 1 out of 550,000 patients being diagnosed to a conflicting report of 1 out of 115,000 patients being diagnosed.

Opsoclonus,"The component features of OMS include repeated, random and rapid eye movements in both horizontal, vertical and diagonal directions (opsoclonus); unsteady gait or loss of ability to stand and walk (ataxia); brief, repeated, shock-like spasms of several muscles within the arms, legs (myoclonus), or tremor interfering with hand use. Behavioral and sleep disturbances, including extreme irritability, inconsolable crying, reduced and fragmented sleep (insomnia) and rage attacks are common. Difficulty articulating speech (dysarthria), sometimes with complete loss of speech and language may occur. Additional symptoms such as decreased muscle tone (hypotonia) and vomiting are common. The most common cause of OMS in young children is paraneoplastic. A small, often hidden tumor presumably provokes the immune system into attacking the nervous system, which may also control the tumor or even cause it to regress. Tumors are NOT in the brain, but are in other areas of the body, usually in chest or abdomen. In 50-80 percent of affected young children, a tumor of embryonic nerve cells (neuroblastoma or ganglioneuroblastoma) is responsible for the symptoms associated with OMS. In other affected individuals, the disorder has been designated ‘idiopathic’ or attributed to various mostly viral infections. However, the high rate of spontaneous tumor regression means that the tumor may be gone before it is looked for. In older children or teens, viral infections are the most frequent apparent cause of OMS. In adults, paraneoplastic etiology is more common, most due to lung or breast cancers. In contrast to paraneoplastic OMS in infants and young children, whose tumors are biologically inactive and often benign, the tumors in adults are commonly malignant, often disseminated. OMS is a rare disorder: 1 per million individuals worldwide. It usually affects infants and young children, although it is also known to affect adults. The peak age in children is about 18 months, with very few diagnosed before 1 year, and a long tail out to about 5 – 6 years. Occurrence of opsoclonus in infants under 6 months old is quite uncommon, and opsoclonus in that age group, when isolated, is usually from another cause. OMS occurs in only slightly more girls than boys. It occurs in about 3% of all children with neuroblastomas. The diagnosis is clinical; there is no diagnostic test yet, as the antigen remains unidentified. The presence of the ‘dancing eyes’, the shock-like muscle spasms, and the impairment of gait, especially if accompanied by irritability, are highly reliable indicators of this syndrome. To detect a tumor in children, either a CT scan with oral and IV contrast or MRI with gadolinium of the neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis need to be done. PET scanning is often done in adults with OMS looking for other occult tumors. In addition, a spinal tap to detect neuroinflammation is necessary. Besides routine tests for infection, recommended CSF studies include so-called “MS panel”, to include oligoclonal bands (with paired serum sample), looking for antibodies secreted by B cells in the CSF. Also, lymphocyte subset analysis (flow cytometry) using immunophenotyping reveals an increased frequency of CSF CD 19+ B cells, which is an invaluable biomarker of OMS disease activity. Autoantibodies in some children with OMS have been at detected in research laboratories, but commercial autoantibody testing is not cost-effective and best reserved for atypical cases.

HTLV-Type-I-and-Type-II,"HTLV-I was first isolated in 1980 from a patient originally thought to have a cutaneous lymphoma. It became clear that it was a distinct form of lymphoma, which was designated as acute T-cell leukemia/ lymphoma (ATL). Some years later, different groups in Martinique and Japan described an association between a chronic disease of the spinal cord and HTLV-I infection, which was later named HTLV-I associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP). Since then, several other conditions have been linked to HTLV infection.","HTLV infection, lymphoma, HTLV-I, tropical spastic paraparesis, ATL, acute T-cell leukemia, HTLV-I associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis, HAM/TSP",RAREDISEASE
Chronic-Intestinal-Pseudo,"CIP affects males and females in equal numbers and can affect individuals of any age. The prevalence of CIP in the general population is unknown. According to some sources approximately 100 new cases of CIP are reported in children in the United States each year. However, CIP often goes unrecognized or misdiagnosed making it extremely difficult to determine the true frequency of CIP in the general population. Children are predominantly affected by primary, non-familial, sporadic CIP. Adults are generally affected by secondary CIP, most often due to systemic diseases such as scleroderma, diabetes, or paraneoplastic syndromes.","scleroderma, primary, non-familial, sporadic CIP, CIP, secondary CIP",RAREDISEASE

Bladder-Exstrophy,"Bladder exstrophy-epispadias-cloacal exstrophy complex is a spectrum of anomalies involving the urinary tract, genital tract, musculoskeletal system and sometimes the intestinal tract. In classic bladder exstrophy, most anomalies are related to defects of the abdominal wall, bladder, genitalia, pelvic bones, rectum and anus. In normal development, the cloacal membrane temporarily separates the urogenital and anal structures and them breaks when tissue that will form abdominal muscles begins to grow in its place.   The bladder exstrophy-epispadias-cloacal exstrophy complex is caused by a developmental abnormality that occurs 4-5 weeks after conception in which the cloacal membrane is not replaced by tissue that will form the abdominal muscles.  The underlying cause of this error in development is not known. The birth prevalence of classic bladder exstrophy has been estimated to be between 1 in 10,000 and 1 in 50,000 livebirths.  Males are affected 2-3 times more often than females.  Isolated epispadias occurs in approximately 1 in 112,000 live male births and 1 in 400,000 live female births.  Cloacal exstrophy occurs in approximately 1 in 400,000 live births. Prenatal ultrasound examination of a fetus with the complex may reveal absence of bladder filling, low-set umbilical cord, separation of pubic bones, small genitals and an abdominal mass that increases in size as the pregnancy progresses.","Cloacal exstrophy, Isolated epispadias, classic bladder exstrophy, Bladder exstrophy-epispadias-cloacal exstrophy complex, bladder exstrophy-epispadias-cloacal exstrophy complex",RAREDISEASE
Myopathy-Myofibrillar,"Myofibrillar myopathies are a group of rare genetic neuromuscular disorders that may be diagnosed in childhood but most often appear after 40 years of age. These conditions are highly variable but are characterized by a slowly progressive muscle weakness that can involve skeletal and smooth muscle. Skeletal muscle weakness can be present in the muscles close to the center of the body (proximal) as well as the distal muscles. A weakening of the heart muscle (cardiomyopathy) is common and may manifest as arrhythmia, conduction defects or congestive heart failure. The frequency of myofibrillar myopathies has not been estimated.  It is likely that these conditions are unrecognized and underdiagnosed. A diagnosis of myofibrillar myopathies is made based on clinical findings, electromyography, nerve conduction studies and muscle biopsy. Molecular genetic testing for the DES, CRYAB, MYOT, LDB3 and ZASP genes is available to confirm the diagnosis. Molecular genetic testing for the BAG3 gene is available on a research basis only.","myofibrillar myopathies, Myofibrillar myopathies",RAREDISEASE
Ameloblastoma,"Ameloblastoma is a rare disorder of the jaw involving abnormal tissue growth. The resulting tumors or cysts are usually not malignant (benign) but the tissue growth may be aggressive in the involved area. On occasion, tissue near the jaws, such as around the sinuses and eye sockets, may become involved as well. The tissues involved are most often those that give rise to the teeth so that ameloblastoma may cause facial distortion. Malignancy is uncommon as are metastases, but they do occur. The cause of ameloblastoma is not understood.  Causes may include injury to the mouth or jaw, infections of the teeth or gums, or inflammation of these same areas.  Infections by viruses or lack of protein or minerals in the persons diet are also suspected of causing the growth or development of these tumors.  In general, however, scientists do not understand the cause of cysts and tumors, nor the reasons why they can become malignant. Ameloblastoma is a rare disorder that affects males and females in equal numbers.  It affects persons of all ethnic backgrounds and of all age groups. Ameloblastoma can show up either in a regular x-ray or in an MRI imaging study.","ameloblastoma, Ameloblastoma",RAREDISEASE
Cyclic-Vomiting-Syndrome,"Cyclic vomiting syndrome affects females somewhat more often than males (55:45). It most commonly occurs in children between the ages of three and seven, although it can begin at any age, from early infancy through to old age (73 is the oldest). Because it is not recognized or misdiagnoses as stomach flu, a correct diagnosis is often delayed for many years. Although CVS is found more often in children, it is being recognized with greater frequency in adults. The incidence of CVS is unknown, although it is not rare. Two studies in Scotland and Australia have suggested that as many as 2% of all Caucasian school-aged children suffer from CVS. However, researchers believe the disorder is underdiagnosed, making it difficult to estimate its true frequency in the general population. CVS was first described in the medical literature in 1806 in French, and 1882 in English. A diagnosis of cyclic vomiting syndrome may be suspected based upon a thorough clinical evaluation, a detailed patient history, and identification of characteristic findings. The diagnostic criteria are currently based upon the consensus criteria of the North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition and the Rome IV Committee. The determination of CVS can only be made after other causes of recurrent vomiting have been ruled out. There is no “test” to prove the presence of cyclic vomiting syndrome, although the presence of urine ketosis early in an episode may be helpful. A variety of tests of may be used to rule out other, more common, causes of recurrent nausea and vomiting, including an upper gastrointestinal radiograph.","CVS, Cyclic vomiting syndrome, cyclic vomiting syndrome",RAREDISEASE
Acquired-Aplastic-Anemia,"Acquired aplastic anemia affects males and females in about equal numbers. Most cases affect older children, teenagers or young adults. The incidence of aplastic anemia in Europe and Israel is two new cases among 1 million people per year. The incidence rate is two or three times greater in Asia. The exact incidence rates exist for the United States is unknown although some sources say that approximately 500-1,000 new cases of aplastic anemia are diagnosed each year. A diagnosis of acquired aplastic anemia may be suspected when an otherwise healthy individual has low levels of all three blood cell types (pancytopenia). A diagnosis may be confirmed by a thorough clinical evaluation, a detailed patient history, and a variety of specialized tests, including a bone marrow biopsy. During this procedure, a small specimen of bone marrow tissue is surgically removed, usually from the hip or pelvis, and studied under a microscope. In acquired aplastic anemia this sample will show a dramatic reduction or complete lack of cells. Additional tests may be necessary to rule out other disorders such as leukemia and to determine if there is an inherited or genetic cause.","aplastic anemia, Acquired aplastic anemia, acquired aplastic anemia, leukemia",RAREDISEASE
Polymorphous-Low,"Polymorphous low-grade adenocarcinoma (PLGA) is a rare tumor of the salivary glands that is limited, to a great extent, to the minor salivary glands and commonly, but not exclusively, localized in the palate of the mouth. The major salivary glands are the parotid glands (at the side of the face, below the ears), the sublingual glands (below the tongue), and the submandibular glands (below the lower jaw).  As the name suggests, each of the major salivary glands is of substantial size and visible to the naked eye. There are about 600 to 1,000 minor salivary glands that are microscopic in size. These minor salivary glands are found in the lining (mucosa) of the lips, tongue, and hard and soft palate, as well as inside the nose, cheeks, and sinuses. A lump or mass in the palate or near any of the salivary glands should be seen by a physician as soon as possible.  A lingering pain in the area of the salivary glands is a signal to see a physician.  A change in the size and/or shape of one of the salivary glands (asymmetry) may be a sufficient reason to see a doctor.  Unexplained bleeding in the mouth is also a symptom warranting attention, and any persistent numbness on any part of the face or a weakening of the muscles on one side of the face should be brought to the attention of a physician.  Early diagnosis and treatment are important. Why a normal cell becomes malignant is not yet fully understood. In most instances PLGA affects people in their middle age.  The median age at which patients are diagnosed is 57 years, with a range of from 22 to 71 years.  For reasons that are unknown, this disease affects slightly more women than men. The diagnosis of PLGA may be suspected on history and clinical examination, but can be confirmed only by biopsy of the affected tissue.","PLGA, Polymorphous low-grade adenocarcinoma",RAREDISEASE
Maple-Syrup-Urine-Disease,"MSUD affects males and females in equal numbers. Estimated incidence is 1 in 185,000 live births.

Chromosome-18-Monosomy-18p,"Chromosome 18, Monosomy 18p is a rare chromosomal disorder in which all or part of the short arm (p) of chromosome 18 is deleted (monosomic). The disorder is typically characterized by short stature, variable degrees of mental retardation, speech delays, malformations of the skull and facial (craniofacial) region, and/or additional physical abnormalities. Associated craniofacial defects may vary greatly in range and severity from case to case. However, such features commonly include an unusually small head (microcephaly); a broad, flat nose; a ""carp-shaped"" mouth; large, protruding ears; widely spaced eyes (ocular hypertelorism); and/or other abnormalities. Rarely (i.e., in about 10 percent of cases), Monosomy 18p may be associated with holoprosencephaly, a condition in which the forebrain (prosencephalon) fails to divide properly during embryonic development. Holoprosencephaly may result in varying degrees of mental retardation, other neurologic findings, and/or extremely variable midline facial defects, such as the presence of a single, central front tooth (maxillary incisor); closely spaced eyes (hypotelorism); an abnormal groove in the upper lip (cleft lip); incomplete closure of the roof of the mouth (cleft palate); and/or, in severe cases, absence of the nose and/or cyclopia. Cyclopia is characterized by fusion of the eye cavities (orbits) into a single cavity containing one eye. Chromosome 18, Monosomy 18p appears to affect females more frequently than males by a ratio of approximately three to two.  Reports indicate that the mean parental age is older than average for the mothers and fathers of children with Monosomy 18p (i.e., age 32 years and 38 years, respectively).  Since Monosomy 18p was originally described in 1963, over 120 cases have been reported in the medical literature.","Holoprosencephaly, Monosomy 18p, cleft palate, holoprosencephaly, Chromosome 18, Monosomy 18p",RAREDISEASE

PNENs affect approximately ~1 in 100,000 individuals in the general population per year. They account for approximately 2-4 percent of all pancreatic neoplasms. A diagnosis of a pancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms is made based upon identification of characteristic symptoms (if present), a detailed patient history, a thorough clinical evaluation and a variety of specialized tests including advanced imaging techniques (octrotide-scintigraphy, CT, MRI, PET-CT, PET-MRI), blood tests (Chromogranin A, NETest), biochemical tests, and also biopsies.","PNENs, pNEN, pNENs",RAREDISEASE
Factor-XIII-Deficiency,"Factor XIII deficiency affects males and females in equal numbers. Symptoms can become apparent at any age. Individuals of any race or ethnicity can be affected.

It primarily affects children between the ages of 6 and 16, and develops after an infection with streptococcal bacteria, such as strep throat or scarlet fever. About 5% of those with untreated strep infection will develop rheumatic fever. Although rheumatic fever is clearly linked to Group A streptococcal infections (strep throat), the exact mechanism causing the disorder is not well understood.  Strep throat is highly contagious, whereas rheumatic fever is not contagious.

Filariasis,"Filariasis is an infectious tropical disease caused by any one of several thread-like parasitic round worms. The two species of worms most often associated with this disease are Wuchereria bancrofti and Brugia malayi. The larval form of the parasite transmits the disease to humans by the bite of a mosquito. In the early stages of the infection, the patient characteristically complains of fever, chills, headaches and skin lesions. Any one of several antiparasitic agents may be effective in eliminating the worm. However, if the disease is left untreated, obstruction of the lymph flow will cause particular areas of the body especially the legs and external genitals, to swell profoundly. Symptoms are primarily a response to adult worms that cause inflammation. Chronic inflammation may progress to hardening of the lymphatic vessels (fibrosis) and obstruction of the lymph flow. Filariasis is a rare infectious tropical disorder caused by the round worm parasites (nematode) Wuchereria bancrofti or Brugia malayi.  Symptoms result primarily from inflammatory reactions to the adult worms.  Some people may also develop hypersensitivity reactions to the small larval parasites (microfilariae). Filariasis is common disease in tropical regions of the world.  The organism W. bancrofti is present throughout Africa, Asia, China, and South America. B. malayi is found in southern and southeast Asia.  Filariasis is extremely rare in North America and occurs only when these organisms are imported from tropical regions.  The infection is transmitted by several different types of tropical mosquitos which transfer the larval stage of the organism (microfilariae) from one host to another. Lymphatic filariasis affects about 120 million people worldwide.  Short-term travelers to areas where it is endemic are at low risk for this infection.  People who visit endemic areas for extended periods of time, and especially those who are in areas or situations in which they are intensely exposed to infected mosquitoes, can become infected.  Most infections seen in the U.S. are in immigrants from endemic countries, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).","Filariasis, Lymphatic filariasis",RAREDISEASE
Stiff-Person-Syndrome,"Stiff-person syndrome (SPS) is a rare acquired neurological disorder characterized by progressive muscle stiffness (rigidity) and repeated episodes of painful muscle spasms. Muscular rigidity often fluctuates (i.e., grows worse and then improves) and usually occurs along with the muscle spasms. Spasms may occur randomly or be triggered by a variety of different events including a sudden noise or light physical contact. In most cases, other neurological signs or symptoms do not occur. The severity and progression of SPS varies from one person to another. If left untreated, SPS can potentially progress to cause difficulty walking and significantly impact a person's ability to perform routine, daily tasks. Although the exact cause of SPS is unknown, it is believed to be an autoimmune disorder and sometimes occurs along with other autoimmune disorders. A diagnosis of SPS is made based upon identification of characteristic symptoms, a detailed patient history, and a thorough clinical evaluation. Additional tests can be used to support a diagnosis and to rule out other conditions. Such tests include screening tests to detect the presence of antibodies against GAD-65, antibodies against amphiphysin (which are associated with paraneoplastic SPS) and an electromyography (EMG), a test that records electrical activity in skeletal (voluntary) muscles at rest and during muscle contraction. An EMG can demonstrate continuous muscle motor unit firing in stiff muscles, which is characteristic of SPS. High doses of diazepam will suppress the characteristic EMG results.","paraneoplastic SPS, SPS, Stiff-person syndrome",RAREDISEASE
Macroglossia,"Macroglossia is the abnormal enlargement of the tongue. In rare cases, macroglossia occurs as an isolated finding that is present at birth (congenital). In many cases, macroglossia may occur secondary to a primary disorder that may be either congenital (e.g., Down syndrome or Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome) or acquired (e.g., as a result of trauma or malignancy). Symptoms and physical findings associated with macroglossia may include noisy, high-pitched breathing (stridor), snoring, and/or feeding difficulties. In some cases, the tongue may protrude from the mouth. When inherited, macroglossia is transmitted as an autosomal dominant genetic trait. Macroglossia is a disorder characterized by a tongue that is large in proportion to other structures in the mouth.  In the congenital type of the disorder, protrusion of the tongue from the mouth may interfere with feeding of the infant.  Later, talking may be affected.  The large size of the tongue may also cause abnormal development of the jaw and teeth, resulting in misaligned or protruding teeth.  Ulceration and dying tissue on the tip of the tongue may be other symptoms of the disorder. Isolated autosomal dominant macroglossia is very rare, with about 50 cases reported in the medical literature.  The prevalence in other instances depends on the underlying disorder for which the macroglossia is secondary.  For example, macroglossia occurs in most cases of Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, and the prevalence of that syndrome is estimated at 1 in 17,000 births. Infants born with isolated autosomal dominant macroglossia present with the obvious sign at birth. A family history and physical exam can confirm the diagnosis.","Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, macroglossia, Down syndrome, isolated autosomal dominant macroglossia, Macroglossia",RAREDISEASE
Fructose-Intolerance-Hereditary,"There are three inherited disorders of fructose metabolism that are recognized and characterized. Essential fructosuria, is a mild disorder not requiring treatment, while Hereditary fructose intolerance (HFI) and Hereditary fructose-1,6-biphosphatase deficiency (HFBP) are treatable and controllable but must be taken seriously. Hereditary Fructose Intolerance may be diagnosed at birth or shortly thereafter when the infant is weaned. Like other autosomal disorders it is equally distributed among males and females.  Estimates of the incidence of the disorder range widely from 1:10,000 to 1:100,000 births. A diagnosis of HFI can be definitively confirmed by either of two tests: an enzyme assay, requiring a liver biopsy, to determine the level of aldolase activity or a fructose tolerance test in which the patient's response to intravenous fructose feeding is carefully monitored. It should be carefully noted, however, that each of these tests carries with it a substantial risk, especially to a newborn child. A non-invasive DNA test is increasingly being recommended instead.","Hereditary Fructose Intolerance, Hereditary fructose intolerance, HFI, Essential fructosuria, Hereditary fructose-1,6-biphosphatase deficiency, HFBP",RAREDISEASE

Anemia-Pernicious,"Pernicious anemia is a rare blood disorder characterized by the inability of the body to properly utilize vitamin B12, which is essential for the development of red blood cells. Most cases result from the lack of the gastric protein known as intrinsic factor, without which vitamin B12 cannot be absorbed. The diagnosis of pernicious anemia may be confirmed by a thorough clinical evaluation, including a detailed patient history and specialized laboratory tests. During a Schilling test, the intestines' ability to absorb vitamin B12 is measured. The vitamin is labeled with radioactive cobalt and is ingested by mouth. X-ray studies can then determine if the body is properly absorbing this vitamin.","pernicious anemia, Pernicious anemia",RAREDISEASE
Spastic-Paraplegia-47,"AP-4-associated hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP) is a group of slowly-progressing neurodegenerative disorders that generally present with global developmental delay, moderate to severe intellectual disability, impaired/absent speech, microcephaly, seizures, and progressive motor symptoms. The conditions included in this group are SPG47, SPG50, SPG51 and SPG52 and all have similar symptoms. These conditions are inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern and are caused by mutations in genes that result in production of an abnormal adaptor protein complex 4. Since many of the initial clinical manifestations of SPG47 are nonspecific and may resemble other disorders characterized by spasticity, developmental delay / intellectual disability, and seizures, the diagnosis is often only made after further diagnostic testing. This may include a brain MRI showing characteristic features such as a thin corpus callosum, wide lateral ventricles and changes in the white matter.

Ahumada,"Ahumada-Del Castillo is a rare endocrine disorder affecting adult females, which is characterized by impairment in the function of the pituitary and hypothalamus glands. Symptoms may include the production of breast milk (lactation) not associated with nursing and the absence of menstrual periods (amenorrhea) due to the lack of monthly ovulation (anovulation). The symptoms of Ahumada-Del Castillo syndrome include the abnormal production of breast milk (galactorrhea) without childbirth and nursing, and the lack of regular menstrual periods (amenorrhea).  Women with this disorder have breasts and nipples of normal size and appearance.  Secondary female sexual characteristics, such as hair distribution and voice, are also normal.  Since the ovaries do not produce eggs, affected females cannot become pregnant. The exact cause of Ahumada-Del Castillo syndrome is not known, although some research suggests that small tumors in the pituitary or hypothalamus glands may be responsible for some cases.  These tumors are frequently microscopic and extremely difficult to detect.  Rarer causes of Ahumada-Del Castillo syndrome may be associated with low levels of thyroid hormone (hypothyroidism), chronic use of drugs that inhibit dopamine (antagonistics) (e.g., chlorpromazine or thorazine), and discontinuation of oral contraceptives (birth control pills).  In all cases, an over-secretion of the milk-producing hormone prolactin (hyperprolactinemia) results in the symptoms of Ahumada-Del Castillo. Ahumada-Del Castillo affects only females. The symptoms usually begin during adulthood.",Ahumada-Del Castillo,RAREDISEASE
Central-Core-Disease,"Central core disease (CCD) is a rare genetic neuromuscular disorder that is classified as a congenital myopathy, meaning that it is a muscle disorder (myopathy) that is present at birth (congenital). Affected infants have diminished muscle tone (hypotonia) resulting in abnormal ""floppiness"", muscle weakness, and a variety of skeletal abnormalities such as side-to-side curvature of the spine (scoliosis). Muscle weakness normally affects the proximal muscles, which are those muscles closest to the center of the body such as the muscles of the shoulder, pelvis and upper arms and legs. Affected infants may experience delays in acquiring motor milestones such as crawling or walking. Some individuals with CCD may be susceptible to developing malignant hyperthermia, a condition in which individuals develop adverse reactions to certain anesthetic drugs. CCD may be very mild or may cause serious complications. Most cases are inherited as autosomal dominant trait and associated with nonprogressive muscle disease and a favorable prognosis. Some cases are inherited as autosomal recessive traits and are more likely to be associated with severe complications.","CCD, congenital myopathy, Central core disease",RAREDISEASE
Primary-Biliary-Cholangitis,"Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) is a chronic, or long lasting, progressive liver disorder that mostly affects women and usually appears during middle age. PBC leads to inflammation and scarring of the small bile ducts (the plumbing system of the liver which transports bile, the substance that helps digest fat). When PBC is very severe, it can lead to yellow discoloration of the skin (jaundice). If PBC is untreated, it can lead to cirrhosis, or scarring of the entire liver, which can lead to liver failure.   PBC is divided into four stages, with stage 1 being early disease, where this is no significant scarring, to stage 4, or which is defined by cirrhosis. Although the exact cause of PBC is unknown, it is thought that it is likely due to a combination of factors such as  autoimmune (when a person’s own immune system attacks their body), genetic, and environmental factors. PBC affects mostly women, but more men are now being diagnosed. The disorder usually becomes apparent during middle age, initially affecting most individuals between the ages of 45 to 65 years. However, the disorder has been diagnosed in females as young as 22 years of age and in females in their early 90s. It has been estimated that PBC is one of the most common autoimmune diseases, affecting nearly 1 in 1000 women over the age of 40.","PBC, Primary biliary cholangitis",RAREDISEASE
Immune-Thrombocytopenia,"Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is an autoimmune bleeding disorder characterized by abnormally low levels of blood cells called platelets, a situation which is referred to as thrombocytopenia. Platelets are specialized blood cells that help maintain the integrity of the walls of our blood vessels and help prevent and stop bleeding by accelerating clotting. A normal platelet count ranges from approximately 150,000 to 400,000 per microliter of blood depending on the laboratory. If someone has a platelet count lower than 100,000 per microliter of blood with no other reason for low platelets, that person might have ITP. There is currently no definitive laboratory test to diagnose ITP. Rather ITP is considered a diagnosis of exclusion (see below) meaning that other causes have been eliminated or are unlikely. What tests to do to exclude other causes is not well-established and can differ among patients and hematologists.","ITP, Immune thrombocytopenia",RAREDISEASE

Renal-Glycosuria,"Renal glycosuria, also known as renal glucosuria, is a rare condition in which the simple sugar glucose is eliminated (excreted) in the urine despite normal or low blood glucose levels. With normal kidney (renal) function, glucose is excreted in the urine only when there are abnormally elevated levels of glucose in the blood. However, in those with renal glycosuria, glucose is abnormally eliminated in the urine due to improper functioning of the renal tubules, which are primary components of the filtering units of the kidneys (nephrons). In most affected individuals, the condition causes no apparent symptoms (asymptomatic) or serious effects. When renal glycosuria occurs as an isolated finding with otherwise normal kidney function, the condition is thought to be inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. Renal glycosuria is a rare condition that appears to affect males and females in equal numbers.  Reported cases of the disorder include affected individuals in several multigenerational families (kindreds).  In most individuals with renal glycosuria, no associated symptoms are apparent (asymptomatic).  Less commonly, under certain conditions, such as during pregnancy or starvation, serious symptoms and findings may become apparent (e.g., dehydration, ketosis). Renal glycosuria is diagnosed based upon laboratory tests that confirm the presence of glucose in the urine in association with normal or low blood glucose levels. (Such testing is typically conducted after overnight fasting.)","renal glucosuria, renal glycosuria, Renal glycosuria",RAREDISEASE
Bloom-Syndrome,"Bloom syndrome is a rare genetic disorder characterized by short stature; increased skin sensitivity to ultraviolet rays from the sun (photosensitivity); multiple small dilated blood vessels (telangiectasia) over the nose and cheeks resembling a butterfly in shape; mild immune deficiency with increased susceptibility to infections; and most importantly, a markedly increased susceptibility to many types of cancer, especially leukemia, lymphoma and gastrointestinal tract tumors. Bloom syndrome is a prototype of a group of genetic conditions known as chromosome breakage syndromes. The genetic abnormality in Bloom syndrome causes problems with DNA repair, resulting in a high number of chromosome breaks and rearrangements. The abnormal DNA repair is responsible for the increased risk for cancer.","lymphoma, chromosome breakage syndromes",RAREDISEASE
Neurotrophic-Keratitis,"Neurotrophic keratitis is a rare disorder. One estimate places the prevalence at below 5 people per every 10,000 in the general population. Prevalence is the number of people who have a disorder in a specific population at a given time; such as how many people have neurotrophic keratitis in the United States in a given year.","neurotrophic keratitis, Neurotrophic keratitis",RAREDISEASE
Emphysema-Congenital-Lobar,"Congenital lobar emphysema is a rare respiratory disorder in which air can enter the lungs but cannot escape, causing overinflation (hyperinflation) of the lobes of the lung. It is most often detected in newborns or young infants, but some cases do not become apparent until adulthood. This disorder may be severe enough to cause associated heart problems (15% of cases) or so mild as to never become apparent. Some cases of congenital lobar emphysema may be caused by autosomal dominant inheritance while others occur for no apparent reason (sporadic). About 50% of cases occur in the first four weeks after birth.  About 75% of cases are found in infants less than six months of age.  This disorder is more common among boys than among girls.","Congenital lobar emphysema, congenital lobar emphysema",RAREDISEASE
Hereditary-Hyperphosphatasia,"Hereditary hyperphosphatasia is a rare genetic bone disorder (osteopathy) that usually becomes apparent during infancy or early childhood. Affected individuals develop progressive skeletal malformations especially in the long bones of the arms and legs. Skeletal malformations in the legs may cause problems walking and may eventually result in short stature. Additional symptoms include pain, fractures of affected bones, and muscle weakness. Because the biochemical and radiographic findings of hereditary hyperphosphatasia are similar to those of Paget's disease (a focal skeletal disorder of adults characterized by abnormal bone turnover), the disorder is sometimes referred to as juvenile Paget's disease. However, despite these similarities, the two disorders are distinct. Hereditary hyperphosphatasia is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. Hereditary hyperphosphatasia affects males and females in equal numbers. Like all recessive disorders it is more common in countries where within-family marriage is practiced. More than 50 cases have been described since the disorder was first reported in the medical literature in 1956. A diagnosis of hereditary hyperphosphatasia is made based upon a thorough clinical evaluation, identification of characteristic symptoms and a variety of x-rays tests that reveal distinct radiographic findings. Affected individuals also have elevated levels of serum alkaline phosphatase and other biochemical markers of bone turnover, detectable through blood and urine tests.","juvenile Paget's disease, hereditary hyperphosphatasia, Hereditary hyperphosphatasia",RAREDISEASE
Dentin-Dysplasia-Type-II,"A diagnosis of coronal dentin dysplasia is made based upon identification of characteristic symptoms, a detailed patient history, and a thorough clinical evaluation. X-rays may reveal abnormal coronal pulp formation, obliteration of the pulp chambers, pulp stones or thistle-shaped deformity of the pulp chamber.",dentin dysplasia,RAREDISEASE
Giant-Axonal-Neuropathy,"Giant axonal neuropathy is a rare neuropathy that severely affects the peripheral as well as the central nervous system. The first symptoms appear in early childhood. This disorder is characterized by abnormalities in the peripheral and central nervous systems including low muscle tone (hypotonia), muscle weakness, decreased reflexes, impaired muscle coordination (ataxia), seizures and intellectual disability. Pale, tightly curled hair is frequently seen in those affected. Giant axonal neuropathy follows autosomal recessive genetic inheritance. Symptoms of giant axonal neuropathy occur in early childhood before the age of seven years. Both the central and peripheral nervous systems are affected. The central nervous system includes the brain and spinal cord and the peripheral nervous system spreads out from the brain and spinal cord to all other areas of the body. Characteristics include low muscle tone (hypotonia), muscle weakness, decreased reflexes, impaired muscle coordination (ataxia), seizures and intellectual disability. In contrast to purely peripheral neuropathies, the reflex of the toes known as Babinski’s sign is often positive, indicating involvement of central motor pathways. Most affected children have pale, tightly curled hair unlike their parent’s hair. Cranial nerves may also be affected leading to facial weakness, abnormal eyes and poor vision. An unusual leg posture is present in some affected children. Skeletal abnormalities such as scoliosis and foot deformities have been described and are thought to be a result of the nervous system dysfunction. Mental development is in most cases initially normal, but later in childhood degenerative mental changes (dementia) may occur as the disorder progresses. Giant axonal neuropathy is rapidly progressive, usually leading to dependence on a wheel chair by the second decade of life and death in the second or third decade. Giant axonal neuropathy is a rare disorder that presents in early childhood. This disorder affects equal numbers of males and females. The prevalence of giant axonal neuropathy and the frequency of carriers of one defective copy of the GAN gene is not known, but it is known that giant axonal neuropathy is a very rare disease. Diagnosis of giant axonal neuropathy is made by clinical findings and specialized tests including nerve conduction velocity, brain MRI and peripheral nerve biopsy. The hallmark finding on a peripheral nerve biopsy is the appearance of ""giant axons"" which are caused by the accumulation of neurofilaments. Molecular genetic testing for abnormalities in the GAN gene is available to confirm the diagnosis. Negative mutation screening of the region of the GAN gene which encodes the protein does not exclude the diagnosis of giant axonal neuropathy.","Giant axonal neuropathy, giant axonal neuropathy",RAREDISEASE
Tongue-Hairy,"Hairy tongue is an uncommon, benign condition that is also known as black hairy tongue or lingua nigra. It is characterized by abnormal elongation and blackish or dark brownish discoloration or ""staining"" of the thread-like elevations (filiform papillae) that cover most of the tongue's surface (dorsum linguae). Such changes often begin at the back (posterior) region of the top of the tongue and extend toward the front (anterior) of the tongue's surface but never involve the undersurface. Hairy tongue is thought to result from failure of the normal “shedding” (desquamation) of the outermost layer of the filiform papillae, overgrowth of certain pigment-producing bacteria or fungi normally present in the mouth, and an abnormal accumulation of pigment residues, keratin, or other debris in the region.  (Keratin is a fibrous protein that is a primary component of the outermost layer of the skin, nails, and hair.)  Although the specific underlying cause of hairy tongue remains unknown, several potential predisposing factors have been implicated.  Such factors include treatment with certain antibiotic medications (e.g., tetracycline therapy, which may lead to overgrowth of certain fungi); the use of particular oral bismuth-containing medications; the use of mouthwashes; smoking; chewing tobacco; excessive alcohol consumption; and/or poor oral hygiene.  Hairy tongue is not infectious nor does it lead to oral cancer. In males or females with hairy tongue, the age of onset is variable.  Hairy tongue most commonly affects adults; however, it may sometimes occur during childhood or adolescence.  It is not an inherited disease. There are additional disorders and conditions that may result in abnormal color changes or other alterations of the tongue.  Such conditions and disorders are typically characterized by symptoms and physical findings that differ from those associated with hairy tongue.  (For further information, choose the specific condition name in question as your search term in the Rare Disease Database.) In individuals with suspected hairy tongue, receiving a thorough evaluation by physicians, dentists, and/or oral surgeons is important to exclude other underlying conditions and to confirm a diagnosis of hairy tongue. Recommended treatment measures typically include removing potential predisposing factors, such as stopping smoking, discontinuing antibiotic therapy if possible and receiving proper alternative treatments as necessary under a physician's direction, and/or other appropriate steps. In addition, affected individuals should speak with their dental specialists for guidance concerning appropriate measures to improve oral hygiene in their particular case. Such measures typically include using a soft-bristled toothbrush to regularly cleanse the tongue.","oral cancer, lingua nigra, black hairy tongue, hairy tongue, Hairy tongue",RAREDISEASE
Paroxysmal-Cold-Hemoglobinuria,"Autoimmune hemolytic anemias as a group are estimated to affect 1-3 people per 100,000 in the general population.  Both the syphilitic and non-syphilitic forms of chronic PCH are exceedingly rare.  The prevalence and incidence rates are unknown.   Anyone may acquire PCH, but it is more common among children than among adults. An individual with a viral infection is at higher risk of contracting the disorder. No known genetic, sex, or racial risk factors exist, although the disease has been reported in families. A diagnosis of PCH may be suspected in some individuals with anemia. In particular, the diagnosis should be suspected in any acutely ill child with hemoglobinuria. A diagnosis is made based upon a thorough clinical evaluation, a detailed patient history, identification of characteristic symptoms and a variety of specialized tests such as a direct antiglobulin test (Coombs) test, which is used to detect certain antibodies that act against red blood cells. A diagnosis of PCH is confirmed by the results of a Donath-Landsteiner test, which can distinguish PCH from other forms of hemolytic anemia. The test consists of incubating a sample of the patient’s serum with normal red blood cells (RBCs) in the cold for 30 minutes and then warming the mixture to body temperature (37C). Hemolysis of the RBCs in this ""bi-phasic"" test indicates a diagnosis of PCH.","PCH, Autoimmune hemolytic anemias",RAREDISEASE
Locked-In-Syndrome,"Locked-in syndrome is a rare neurological disorder that affects males and females in equal numbers. Locked-in syndrome can affect individuals of all ages including children, but most often is seen in adults who are more at risk for brain stroke and bleeding. Because cases of locked-in syndrome may go unrecognized or misdiagnosed, it is difficult to determine the actual number of individuals who have had the disorder in the general population.","locked-in syndrome, Locked-in syndrome",RAREDISEASE
Ventricular-Septal-Defects,"Ventricular septal defects are heart defects that are present at birth (congenital). The normal heart has four chambers. The two upper chambers, known as atria, are separated from each other by a fibrous partition known as the atrial septum. The two lower chambers are known as ventricles and are separated from each other by the ventricular septum. Valves connect the atria (left and right) to their respective ventricles. The aorta, the main vessel of arterial circulation, carries blood from the left ventricle and away from the heart. The exact cause of VSDs is not known. These defects probably occur as the result of errors in the development of an embryo. During the early part of fetal development there is no wall (septum) to separate the left and right ventricles. As the fetus grows, so does a muscular wall that splits the lower chamber into two ventricles.  If the muscle does not form a solid wall, a hole remains and is what is called the ventricular septal defect. The why and how of these developmental errors is not fully understood. However, research suggests that they may occur as the result of the complex interaction of many factors, both genetic and environmental (multifactorial).","VSDs, Ventricular septal defects, ventricular septal defect",RAREDISEASE
Hypothalamic-Hamartoma,"Hypothalamic hamartomas (HH) are rare, tumor-like malformations that occur during fetal development and are present at birth. They are non-progressive lesions and do not expand, spread or metastasize to other locations. They grow in proportion to normal brain growth, and consequently their relative size to the rest of the brain is the same for the lifetime of the patient. There is tremendous diversity in the type and severity of symptoms from patient to patient. However, symptoms are apparent during childhood in the overwhelming majority of patients. Two clinical phenotypes of HH are recognized: 1) central precocious puberty and 2) epilepsy and related neurobehavioral symptoms. Hypothalamic hamartomas are relatively rare. Population-based research has shown that HH with epilepsy occurs in 1 of 200,000 children and adolescents. The prevalence of HH with only precocious puberty is unknown. At least for HH with epilepsy, males appear to have a slightly higher risk than females (approximately 1.3 to 1 ratio). HH occurs worldwide, without any obvious geographical concentration of cases. It is currently felt that all ethnic groups are at equal risk. There are no identified maternal risk factors or fetal exposures that increase the risk of HH. As malformations of the ventral (inferior) hypothalamus, hypothalamic hamartomas are rather distinct from other conditions. It is important to note that tumors that occur in the same region (such as craniopharyngiomas, astrocytomas, optic nerve gliomas, etc) usually do not cause gelastic seizures. These tumors can, however, be associated with endocrine dysfunction, which includes precocious puberty under rare circumstances.","central precocious puberty, Hypothalamic hamartomas, hypothalamic hamartomas, astrocytomas, HH, optic nerve gliomas, craniopharyngiomas",RAREDISEASE
Conradi-Hunermann-Syndrome,"Conradi-Hünermann syndrome is a rare genetic disorder characterized by skeletal malformations, skin abnormalities, cataracts and short stature. The specific symptoms and severity of the disorder may vary greatly from one individual to another. Conradi-Hünermann syndrome is classified as a form of chondrodysplasia punctata, a group of disorders characterized by the formation of small, hardened spots of calcium on the ""growing portion"" or heads of the long bones (stippled epiphyses) or inside other areas of cartilage in the body. Conradi-Hünermann syndrome is commonly associated with disproportionate and assymetric shortening of long bones, particularly those of the upper arms (humeri) and the thigh bones (femora), curvature of the spine and mild to moderate growth deficiency, resulting in short stature. Many affected individuals also have a prominent forehead; unusually flattened midfacial regions (midfacial hypoplasia), with a low nasal bridge; loss of transparency of the lenses of the eyes (cataracts); sparse, coarse scalp hair; and/or abnormal thickening, dryness, and scaling of the skin. Conradi-Hünermann syndrome is inherited as an X-linked dominant trait that occurs almost exclusively in females.","Conradi-Hünermann syndrome, chondrodysplasia punctata",RAREDISEASE
Amniotic-Band-Syndrome,"Amniotic band syndrome is a well-known condition potentially associated with a variety of different birth defects. The abnormalities occur after the affected parts of the body have formed normally in early development. The severity of amniotic band syndrome can range from a single, isolated finding to multiple, disfiguring complications. The arms and legs are most often affected. The head and face and, in some patients, various internal organs can also be affected. The exact cause of amniotic band syndrome is unknown and controversial. Two main theories have been proposed to explain the development of the disorder. One theory attributes the disorder to causes that arise internally within the fetus (intrinsic theory); the other theory attributes the disorder to causes acting upon the fetus externally (extrinsic theory). It is likely that both internal and external factors can cause the amniotic band syndrome, and that the cause of the disorder in one infant may be different from the cause in another infant.","amniotic band syndrome, Amniotic band syndrome",RAREDISEASE
Norrie-Disease,"Norrie disease is a rare X-linked disorder that occurs due to errors or disruption (mutations) of the NDP gene. Norrie disease is a rare disorder that is fully expressed in males only. In rare cases, carrier females may display some symptoms of the disorder. The incidence and prevalence rates for Norrie disease are unknown. The disorder has been reported in all ethnic groups. A diagnosis of Norrie disease is suspected based upon a detailed patient history, a thorough clinical evaluation, and identification of characteristic findings. There may be a family history supporting X-linked inheritance. A diagnosis may be confirmed by molecular genetic testing in which a mutation in the defective gene (NDP) is identified. Such testing is available through clinical testing labs (www.genetests.org).",Norrie disease,RAREDISEASE
Phosphoglycerate-Kinase-Deficiency,"Phosphoglycerate kinase deficiency is a very rare disorder that is fully expressed in males only. However, females who carry a single copy of the disease gene (heterozygous carriers) may exhibit some symptoms associated with the disorder (i.e., hemolytic anemia). The disorder can be diagnosed at birth when enzymatic testing is done. More than 30 cases of PGK deficiency have been written up in the medical literature. It is thought that there are people with the disease who do not receive a diagnosis. The diagnosis is made on the basis of a thorough physical examination and confirmed by the results of laboratory tests.","PGK, Phosphoglycerate kinase deficiency",RAREDISEASE

MELAS-Syndrome,"MELAS (Mitochondrial Encephalopathy, Lactic Acidosis, and Stroke-like episodes) syndrome is a rare disorder that begins in childhood, usually between two and fifteen years of age, and mostly affects the nervous system and muscles. The most common early symptoms are seizures, recurrent headaches, loss of appetite and recurrent vomiting. Stroke-like episodes with temporary muscle weakness on one side of the body (hemiparesis) may also occur and this can lead to altered consciousness, vision and hearing loss, loss of motor skills and intellectual disability. MELAS is caused by mutations in mitochondrial DNA and in one patient, this syndrome has been associated with mutations in a nuclear gene, POLG1. MELAS syndrome is a rare disorder that affects males and females in equal numbers. Although rare, MELAS syndrome is probably the most common type of mitochondrial myopathy caused by mutations in mtDNA. Some researchers believe that mitochondrial myopathies may go unrecognized and underdiagnosed in the general population, making it difficult to determine the true frequency of disorders like MELAS syndrome.","Mitochondrial Encephalopathy, Lactic Acidosis, and Stroke-like episodes, mitochondrial myopathy, MELAS, MELAS syndrome",RAREDISEASE
Mulibrey-Nanism,"Mulibrey nanism is an extremely rare autosomal recessive genetic disorder characterized by profound growth delays and distinctive abnormalities of the muscles, liver, brain, and eyes. The acronym MULIBREY stands for (MU)scle, (LI)ver, (BR)ain, and (EY)e.  Nanism is another word for dwarfism. A characteristic feature not included in the original acronym is the overgrowth of the fibrous sac that surrounds the heart restricting normal filling of the heart (constrictive pericarditis). Characteristic symptoms may include low birth weight, short stature, and severe progressive growth delays. Muscles are usually underdeveloped and lack normal tone (hypotonia). Some infants with this disorder may have an abnormally large liver (hepatomegaly). Infants typically have yellow discoloration in their eyes. Mulibrey nanism is an extremely rare disorder that affects males and females in equal numbers.   Approximately 110 patients have been reported worldwide with this condition.

Turcot-Syndrome,"Turcot syndrome is a rare inherited disorder characterized by the association of benign growths (adenomatous polyps) in the mucous lining of the gastrointestinal tract with tumors of the central nervous system. Symptoms associated with polyp formation may include diarrhea, bleeding from the end portion of the large intestine (rectum), fatigue, abdominal pain, and weight loss. Affected individuals may also experience neurological symptoms, depending upon the type, size and location of the associated brain tumor. Some researchers believe that Turcot syndrome is a variant of familial adenomatous polyposis. Others believe that it is a separate disorder. The exact cause of Turcot syndrome is not known. Turcot syndrome affects males and females in equal numbers. Approximately 150 cases have been reported in the medical literature.","familial adenomatous polyposis, Turcot syndrome",RAREDISEASE
Carpenter-Syndrome,"Carpenter syndrome belongs to a group of rare genetic disorders known as “acrocephalopolysyndactyly” (ACPS) disorders. All forms of ACPS are characterized by premature closure of the fibrous joints (cranial sutures) between certain bones of the skull (craniosynostosis), causing the top of the head to appear pointed (acrocephaly); webbing or fusion (syndactyly) of certain fingers or toes (digits); and/or more than the normal number of digits (polydactyly). Carpenter syndrome is also known as ACPS type II. Carpenter syndrome appears to affect males and females in relatively equal numbers. More than 70 cases of the disorder have been recorded. In 10 patients that had sequence analysis for the disease causing gene, homozygosity (two copies) for the same nonsense mutation, (a change in the DNA that causes a change in the protein) was found. This is indicative of a founder effect in patients of northern European descent, which means that a high prevalence of a genetic disorder in an isolated or inbred population is due to the fact that many members of the population are derived from a common ancestor who had the disease causing mutation.","disorders acrocephalopolysyndactyly, craniosynostosis, acrocephaly, ACPS type II, ACPS, Carpenter syndrome",RAREDISEASE
Yellow-Nail-syndrome,"Yellow nail syndrome is an extremely rare disorder characterized by malformations affecting the fingernails and toenails, abnormalities affecting the lungs and the airways (respiratory tract), and swelling or puffiness in different parts of the body because of the accumulation of protein-rich fluid (lymph) in the soft layers of tissue under the skin (lymphedema). Yellow nail syndrome usually affects older adults. The exact cause of yellow nail syndrome is not known. Occasionally, yellow nail syndrome has been reported to run in families suggesting that genetic factors may play a role in the development of the disorder in some patients. A diagnosis of yellow nail syndrome is made based upon a thorough clinical evaluation, a detailed patient history and identification of characteristic findings.

Glanzmann-Thrombasthenia,"The symptoms of Glanzmann thrombasthenia usually begin at birth or shortly thereafter and include the tendency to bruise and bleed easily and sometimes profusely, especially after surgical procedures. Other symptoms may include susceptibility to easy bruising, nosebleeds (epistaxis), bleeding from the gums (gingival), intermittent gastrointestinal bleeding, and/or variably large red or purple colored spots on the skin that are caused by bleeding in the skin (purpura). Women with GT often also have unusually heavy menstrual bleeding, irregular uterine bleeding, and excess bleeding in childbirth. Rarely, internal bleeding and blood in the urine (hematuria) can occur. The severity of the symptoms varies greatly. Some affected individuals have mild bruising and others have severe hemorrhages that can be life threatening. Glanzmann thrombasthenia is a rare disorder that affects males and females in equal numbers. The symptoms of this disease are usually apparent at birth (neonates) or during infancy. Approximately 500 cases have been reported, but many cases have probably not been reported.

Chromosome-5-Trisomy-5p,"Trisomy 5p is a rare chromosomal disorder in which all or a portion of the short arm (p) of chromosome 5 (5p) appears three times (trisomy) rather than twice in cells of the body. Often the duplicated portion of 5p (trisomy) is due to a complex rearrangement involving other chromosomes. These individuals have a variable phenotype depending on which chromosome is involved, the size of the duplication and whether there is loss of material from the same or another chromosome. In observed cases, trisomy 5p has appeared to affect females slightly more often than males and affects all ethnic groups. More than 40 cases have been described since the original description by Lejeune in 1964. While the features for trisomy 5p appear consistent, the diagnosis cannot be made on clinical features alone. Many of the features seen in trisomy 5p can be seen in other genetic conditions or chromosomal abnormalities.

Meningitis-Bacterial,"Bacterial Meningitis is a central nervous system disease caused by certain types of bacteria. Meningitis is characterized by inflammation of the membranes (meninges) around the brain or spinal cord. Inflammation can begin suddenly (acute) or develop gradually (subacute). Major symptoms may include fever, headache, and a stiff neck, sometimes with aching muscles. Nausea, vomiting and other symptoms may occur. In the United States, approximately 2,600 sporadic cases of Bacterial Meningitis are reported each year.  Meningitis caused by pneumococcal infections affects about 1.1 in 100,000 individuals.  Meningitis caused by haemophilus influenza affects about .2 in 100,000 individuals.  About 70 percent of all Bacterial Meningitis occurs in children aged 5 and under.  Children under age 2 are at highest risk for infection, and males are affected more often than females.  Bacterial Meningitis in general occurs most often during the first month of a newborn’s life and is usually caused by gram-negative bacteria such as Escherichia coli or by group B streptococcus.  Bacterial Meningitis caused by Hemophilus influenzae type B occurs most often in infants over 1 month old and young children.  However, in the United States, this type of Bacterial Meningitis occurs more often in adults as a result of a vaccine that has led to a decline in the number of affected infants and children.   Bacterial Meningitis caused by pneumococcus bacteria occurs most often in adults, but there are an estimated 1,400 cases of pneumococcal meningitis each year among children under age five. Testing for Bacterial Meningitis may include imaging techniques such as CT scans or MR imaging. Other testing may include examination of the patient's blood and/or skin.

Children with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome may also develop cognitive dysfunction, delays in reaching developmental milestones and behavioral problems. Lennox-Gastaut syndrome can be caused by a variety of underlying conditions, but in some cases no cause can be identified. Lennox-Gastaut syndrome can be difficult to treat because it is resistant (refractory) to many kinds of antiseizure medications.

The mean age of presentation is about 50 years, but the range of patient ages in reported cases is from eight days to 90 years. Fournier gangrene is diagnosed more frequently among males. It may be that the high male to female ratio in the diagnosis is the result of the lack of recognition of this entity among women by physicians. It is believed that the male to female proportion may be anywhere from 5:1 to 10:1.",Fournier gangrene,RAREDISEASE
Congenital-Fiber-Type-Disproportion,"Congenital fiber type disproportion (CFTD) is a rare genetic muscle disease that is usually apparent at birth (congenital myopathy). It belongs to a group of muscle conditions called the congenital myopathies that tend to affect people in a similar pattern. Major symptoms may include loss of muscle tone (hypotonia) and generalized muscle weakness. Delays in motor development are common and people with more marked muscle weakness also have abnormal side-to-side curvature of the spine (scoliosis), dislocated hips, and the permanent fixation of certain joints in a flexed position (contractures), particularly at the ankle. CFTD affects males and females in equal numbers. The incidence of the disorder in the general population is unknown but it is uncommon. The disorder is usually present at birth (congenital) but may not be recognized for many months. Case reports describing children with the features of CFTD first appeared in the medical literature in the 1960s and 70s. The term congenital fiber type disproportion was first used in 1973.","Congenital fiber type disproportion, CFTD, congenital myopathy",RAREDISEASE
Rabies,"Rabies is an infectious disease that can affect all species of warmblooded animals, including man. This disorder is transmitted by the saliva of an infected animal and is caused by a virus (Neurotropic lyssavirus) that affects the salivary glands and the central nervous system. The symptoms may lead to serious complications if the virus is not treated immediately. Rabies in humans has been almost completely eliminated in most developed countries.  The vaccinations of domesticated animals and elimination of stray dogs has helped control this problem.  In the 1980’s the U.S. Centers for Disease Control had one case per year reported.  In the United States rabies is found primarily among wild animals such as skunks, foxes, bats, and raccoons.  There were 49 cases of human rabies reported in the U.S. between 1960 and 1986.  Only 7 of the 49 cases were acquired by exposure to rabid domesticated animals.  The remainder were from wild animals.","rabies, Rabies",RAREDISEASE
Sutton-Disease-II,"Sutton disease II is characterized by the recurring eruption of painful inflamed ulcers in the mouth (stomatitis). There may be multiple ulcers of varying sizes. These ulcers in the mouth are commonly called canker sores. Sutton disease II is also known as recurrent aphthous stomatitis. The exact cause of this disease is not fully understood, although it may be due to an abnormal immune response to the bacteria that are normally in the mouth. The exact cause of Sutton disease II is not known.  Several studies suggest that it may occur because of an abnormal immune response to the bacteria that are normally present in the mouth.  Deficiencies of iron, vitamin B12, and folic acid seem to increase an individual’s susceptibility to this disease. Stress and local injury may also be involved.  There seems to be no relationship between Sutton disease II and menstruation, pregnancy, and/or menopause, nor is it caused by herpes virus, which is the main cause of common canker sores. Sutton disease II affects more adult females than males.  However, before puberty, males and females are equally affected.  This disease occurs most frequently in malnourished children or adults whose immune systems are suppressed (i.e., by chemotherapy) or compromised (i.e., acquired immune deficiency syndrome).","Sutton disease II, recurrent aphthous stomatitis",RAREDISEASE

Bernard,"The symptoms of Bernard-Soulier syndrome, which are typically apparent at birth and continue throughout life, may include the tendency to bleed excessively from cuts and other injuries, nosebleeds (epistaxis), and/or an unusually heavy menstrual flow in women. Some babies and children with BSS have no symptoms and the disorder does not present until adult life. People with this disease also bruise easily and the bruises tend to linger. Bleeding from very small blood vessels under the skin (subcutaneous) may cause small or widespread areas of small red or purple colored spots (purpura or petechiae). Bernard-Soulier syndrome is a rare bleeding disorder that affects males and females in equal numbers. Recent estimates suggest that Bernard Soulier syndrome affects 1 in a million people. More than 200 cases have been reported worldwide. The diagnosis of Bernard-Soulier syndrome is made by a combination of blood testing to reveal whether platelets are at abnormally low levels (thrombocytopenia), microscopic examination to determine the presence of abnormally large platelets and irregularly shaped platelets, and a test called ‘flow cytometry, which is able to measure the level of expression of the missing protein ion the outside of platelets affected by Bernard-Soulier syndrome. In recent years, most families are offered molecular genetic testing to identify which gene carries the mutations.","BSS, Bernard-Soulier syndrome, Bernard Soulier syndrome",RAREDISEASE
Liposarcoma,"The specific cause of liposarcoma is still unknown. Clinically, it can be first noticed particularly in the extremity in an area of recent trauma where the patient may find a mass, however the cause and effect are quite likely purely coincidental. Liposarcoma generally is attributed to a change in some of the genes that are normally present in fat cells.  A series of abnormalities in these genes (mutations or DNA alterations) can lead to malignant changes characterized by uncontrollable growth. Liposarcoma is a soft tissue sarcoma, affecting approximately 2000 individuals each year in the United States. It affects men more than women, and more specifically middle-aged men ranging from 50 – 65 years of age. Children are rarely diagnosed, but when liposarcoma does occur in children, it is usually during adolescence. There is no specific ethnicity in which liposarcoma is more common. Certain risk factors have been shown to predispose individuals to developing soft tissue sarcomas, such as liposarcoma, including: prior radiation, familial cancer syndromes, damage to the lymph system, and long term exposure to certain toxic chemicals such as vinyl chloride, a chemical used to make plastic. There are other diseases that can present very similarly to liposarcoma. Lipoma is a non-cancerous (benign) tumor that can look similar to liposarcoma but it is usually softer and feels like a mass directly below the skin rather than in deeper parts of the body. A lipoma cannot transform into a liposarcoma. Other soft tissue tumors, such as undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma, lipomatous hemangiopericytoma, non-lipogenic sarcoma and gastrointestinal stromal tumors, can also look similar to liposarcoma when initially evaluated under a microscope.","non-lipogenic sarcoma, gastrointestinal stromal tumors, lipomatous hemangiopericytoma, liposarcoma, Liposarcoma, soft tissue sarcomas, soft tissue sarcoma, undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma, lipoma, Lipoma",RAREDISEASE
Pyruvate-Dehydrogenase-Complex-Deficiency,"Common symptoms of PDCD may initially be poor feeding, lethargy and rapid breathing (tachypnea) in an infant. Neurologic symptoms are progressive and usually start in infancy but may even be apparent at birth. These symptoms can include motor delay, poor muscle tone, seizures, incoordination (ataxia), abnormal eye movements and poor visual tracking. Infants with the prenatal onset form may demonstrate brain malformations on neuroimaging. Individuals with the early childhood-onset form of PDCD may have normal neurologic development with intermittent periods of ataxia, often associated with upper respiratory infection or other minor stress. Varying degrees of neurologic deficits and mental retardation may occur in individuals with PDCD. Several hundred cases of PDCD have been reported. More males than females have severe disease and early death and progressive neurological symptoms are observed more often in females, although some females have severe symptoms. Biochemical abnormalities may vary from severe acidosis (due to abnormally high levels of lactic acid) appearing shortly after birth to a mildly elevated level which usually follows a meal high in carbohydrates. In some cases elevation of blood lactate levels is seen only during the acute episodes. Excretion of abnormally large amounts of the amino acid alanine (alaninuria) may occur only during acute episodes. Imaging studies such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) may reveal structural brain abnormalities associated with severe disease. A definitive diagnosis can be made by demonstrating abnormal PDC enzyme levels or function in leukocytes, fibroblasts or from a tissue biopsy.",PDCD,RAREDISEASE
Mayer,"Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser (MRKH) syndrome is a rare disorder that affects women. It is characterized by the failure of the uterus and the vagina to develop properly in women who have normal ovarian function and normal external genitalia. Women with this disorder develop normal secondary sexual characteristics during puberty (e.g., breast development and pubic hair), but do not have a menstrual cycle (primary amenorrhea). Often, the failure to begin the menstrual cycle is the initial clinical sign of MRKH syndrome. The range and severity of MRKH syndrome can vary greatly and the disorder is generally broken down into type I, which occurs as an isolated finding, and type II, which occurs with abnormalities of additional organ systems including mainly the kidneys and the skeleton. Because of the nature of the disorder, MRKH syndrome can cause significant psychological challenges and counseling is recommended. The exact cause of MRKH syndrome remains largely unknown, but there is now no doubt of a genetic origin. In this respect, an update on the most recent research publications shows the involvement of several chromosomal segments, some of them including genes likely to account for the disorder.","MRKH, MRKH syndrome, Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser",RAREDISEASE
Acquired-Neuromyotonia,"Acquired neuromyotonia is an autoimmune disease in which the immune system malfunctions so that it damages parts of one’s own body. Approximately 40% of affected individuals have antibodies to voltage-gated potassium channels (VGKC’s) that affect the points at which the signals from the nerve fiber meet the muscle cell (neuromuscular junction). Aquired neuromyotonia is a rare disorder affecting males and females but is slightly more common among men. Disease onset is usually between the ages of 15 and 60 years but has also been reported in childhood. The diagnosis of acquired neuromyotonia is based on the presence of continuous muscle contractions (myokymia), especially in the face and hands, rhythmic tics or twitches (fasciculations), and muscle cramps. The diagnosis is confirmed by studies of the electrical signs of muscle activity (electromyography).","Aquired neuromyotonia, Acquired neuromyotonia, acquired neuromyotonia",RAREDISEASE
Refractory-Celiac-Disease,"Refractory celiac disease (RCD) is a complex autoimmune disorder much like the more common celiac disease but, unlike celiac disease, it is resistant or unresponsive to at least 12 months of treatment with a strict gluten-free diet. Gliadin, a component of the wheat storage protein gluten, together with similar proteins in barley and rye, are the villains that trigger the immune reaction in celiac disease. The diagnosis of RCD is made by exclusion, especially of any other disorder that can affect the huge number of thread-like projections that line the interior of the intestine (intestinal villi), such as intestinal lymphoma, Crohn's disease, small intestinal bacterial overgrowth or hypogammaglobulinemia. Refractory celiac disease is rare among adults and is almost never seen in children. Data regarding the true incidence and prevalence of RCD are unreliable, but some have estimated that there might be 20,000 patients in the USA. However, those estimations are based on incomplete data. In one recent study, 1.5% of patients diagnosed with celiac disease at a single US center developed RCD. Of those with RCD 85% had the less severe Type I RCD. Virtually all clinicians studying refractory celiac disease emphasize that the diagnosis is based on eliminating all other possible sources of the symptoms and intestinal injury. One article lists more than 10 conditions that must be considered and eliminated before a convincing diagnosis of refractory celiac disease may be made. As noted above, examination of the interior wall of the intestine (upper and lower) by means of an enteroscope or colonoscope as well as obtaining intestinal biopsies to be examined under a microscope is useful, especially to determine if the symptoms are the result of intestinal disorders other than RCD. Capsule endoscopy, which examines the small intestinal lining using a camera mounted on a swallowed pill, may also be useful in evaluating the degree of small intestinal inflammation and injury.  Some specialized centers are able to offer sophisticated examinations of the biopsy materials that in many cases will assist in the diagnosis. These studies emphasize the presence of abnormal populations of T lymphocytes in the tissue indicating a diagnosis of the more aggressive Type II RCD. Other imaging studies (barium X-ray, CT scan, capsule enteroscopy and MRE) may be undertaken, especially if there is concern for the presence of a lymphoma. Several therapies for RCD have been tried in uncontrolled tests with inconclusive results. Among the therapies tested in this way are: elemental diet (an elemental diet is a liquid diet consisting of nutrients that require no digestion, including amino acids, carbohydrates, vitamins, minerals, and triglycerides); and total parental nutrition (TPN) that is defined as nutrition maintained entirely by intravenous injection or by some other nongastrointestinal route. Steroid therapy is a mainstay of treatment but its beneficial effect is short-lived in patients of lymphoma. Treatment involving other immunosuppressive drugs such as azathioprine, cyclosporine, enteric-coated budesonide, 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA), or inflixamab has been used with a limited number of patients.  More recently chemotherapy with cladribine with or without autologous stem cell transplantation has also been reported to be useful.","intestinal disorders, celiac disease, complex autoimmune disorder, hypogammaglobulinemia",DISEASE
Hemimegalencephaly,"Hemimegalencephaly (HME) is a rare neurological condition in which one-half of the brain, or one side of the brain, is abnormally larger than the other. The structure of the brain on the affected side may be markedly abnormal or show only subtle changes. In either case, as a consequence of this size and structural differences, the enlarged brain tissue causes frequent seizures, often associated with cognitive or behavioral disabilities. Seizures in association with HME often begin in early infant life including an association with infantile spasms. Hemimegalencephaly may occur as an isolated or sporadic brain malformation or it may be associated with other neurodevelopmental syndromes. Thus, when detected, HME should prompt a search for other syndromic diagnoses. Hemimegalencephaly is a very rare disorder for which prevalence estimates are not available. Examination by MRI is usually sufficient to confirm a suspected case of HME. Thus, an MRI examination should be performed as soon as HME is suspected. Seizures are diagnosed and defined by electroencephalography (EEG).","neurodevelopmental syndromes, neurological condition",DISEASE
Autosomal-Dominant-Hyper-IgE-Syndrome,"Autosomal dominant hyper IgE syndrome (AD-HIES) is a rare multisystem primary immunodeficiency disorder. Symptoms often become apparent early during infancy or childhood. The disorder is characterized by repeated bacterial infections of the skin and lungs (pneumonia), skeletal abnormalities, and characteristic facial features. The first symptom is often the development of a dry, red flaky skin rash (eczema) at birth or early during infancy. Researchers have discovered that mutations in the STAT3 gene cause AD-HIES in over 60% of the patients. Most cases of AD-HIES occur as the result of a new mutation in this gene. There are two main forms of hyper IgE syndrome - one inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern and one in an autosomal recessive pattern. Both involve defects of the immune system and elevated levels of immunoglobulin E (hyper IgE) in the blood. For years, researchers considered them different expressions of the same disorder, but now researchers consider them similar, yet distinct disorders.","multisystem primary immunodeficiency disorder, pneumonia",DISEASE

Adenylosuccinate-Lyase-Deficiency,"Adenylosuccinate lyase deficiency (ASLD) is a rare, inherited metabolic disorder due to a lack of the enzyme adenylosuccinate lyase (ASL). The defect is characterized by the appearance of two unusual chemicals, succinylaminoimidazole carboxamide riboside (SAICA riboside) and succinyladenosine, in cerebrospinal fluid, in urine and, to a much smaller extent, in plasma. These compounds, which are never found in healthy individuals, are formed from the two natural compounds acted upon by the enzyme. The symptoms and the physical findings associated with ASLD vary greatly from case to case. As a rule, patients with ASLD present with a mix of neurological symptoms that usually will include some of the following: psychomotor retardation, autistic features, epilepsy, axial hypotonia with peripheral hypertonia, muscle wasting, and secondary feeding problems. Although abnormal physical features (dysmorphism) are not common, when they do occur they may include severe growth failure, small head circumference, brachycephaly, flat occiput, prominent metopic suture, intermittent divergent strabismus, small nose with anteverted nostrils, long and smooth philtrum, thin upper lip, and low set ears.","inherited metabolic disorder, muscle wasting, epilepsy, divergent strabismus",DISEASE
Kohler-Disease,"Kohler disease is a rare bone disorder of the foot in children that may be the result of stress-related compression at a critical time during the period of growth. It is characterized by limping caused by pain and swelling in the foot. It most often occurs in children between the ages 3-7, and affects males five times more often than females. Usually, just one foot is affected so children typically walk on the side portion of the foot. A diagnosis of Kohler disease is suspected based on the presence of the signs of symptoms in the child. The clinical diagnosis of Kohler disease is reinforced by X-rays that show flattening, sclerosis, and fragmentation of the navicular bone, which can be compared to the unaffected side to make the diagnosis. However, these abnormalities of the navicular bone are bilateral in approximately 25% of patients and may be seen in children who do not have Kohler disease.",bone disorder,DISEASE
Prune-Belly-Syndrome,"Prune-Belly syndrome, also known as Eagle-Barrett syndrome, is a rare disorder characterized by partial or complete absence of the stomach (abdominal) muscles, failure of both testes to descend into the scrotum (bilateral cryptorchidism), and/or urinary tract malformations. The urinary malformations may include abnormal widening (dilation) of the tubes that bring urine to the bladder (ureters), accumulation of urine in the ureters (hydroureter) and the kidneys (hydronephrosis), and/or backflow of urine from the bladder into the ureters (vesicoureteral reflux). Complications associated with Prune-Belly syndrome may include underdevelopment of the lungs (pulmonary hypoplasia) and/or chronic renal failure. The exact cause of Prune-Belly syndrome is not known. Prune Belly syndrome is a very rare disorder that is present at birth.  The disorder affects mostly males but a few female cases have been described in the medical literature. The diagnosis is usually obvious from birth, but care and time are required to determine the location and number of abnormalities. A full understanding of the complications will involve imaging tests such as ultrasound, X-ray, and, in order to determine the extent of involvement of the genitourinary tract, intravenous pyelogram (IVP). An IVP makes use of a dye to map the degree of involvement of the kidneys and their ducts.","hydronephrosis, cryptorchidism, renal failure, vesicoureteral reflux",DISEASE

Pneumocystis-Pneumonia,"Pneumocystis pneumonia is characterized by a gradual onset with shortness of breath and/or difficulty breathing. This disorder may be accompanied with fevers, night sweats, weight loss and dry cough. Dry cough is one distinction from typical pneumonia because spit (sputum) is too thick to become productive, therefore productive cough is not as common in PJP. Uncommonly, the PJP fungus can spread to other body organs such as the liver, kidney and spleen as the disease progresses. PJP is a frequent AIDS-defining diagnosis in the United States and in Europe. Pneumocystis pneumonia is commonly seen in HIV infected people with a CD4 count of less than 200 cells/mm3. People receiving high doses of glucocorticoids or other immunosuppressive drugs after an organ transplant or to treat cancer are at risk for PJP. People with other inflammatory conditions such as granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener’s), polymyositis or dermatomyositis can also have an increased risk of acquiring PJP. The diagnosis of Pneumocystis pneumonia requires multiple tests such as a chest X-ray and a sample of sputum collected by a procedure called bronchoalveolar lavage to differentiate PJP between from other causes of pneumonia. To further confirm PJP, a test to amplify trace amounts of DNA (polymerase chain reaction or PCR) is used and a blood test to detect β-D-glucan is used.","AIDS, HIV, pneumonia, cancer",DISEASE
Cone-Dystrophy,"Cone dystrophy is a general term used to describe a group of rare eye disorders that affect the cone cells of the retina. Cone dystrophy can variably cause a variety of symptoms including decreased visual clarity (acuity) when looking straight ahead (central vision), a reduced ability to see colors and an increased sensitivity to light (photophobia). Cone dystrophy may be broken down into two broad groups - stationary and progressive. In stationary cone dystrophy symptoms tend to remain stable and are usually present at birth or early childhood. In progressive cone dystrophy symptoms slowly become worse over time. There are several different forms of cone dystrophy. The age of onset, progression and severity of cone dystrophy can vary greatly from one person to another, even among individuals with the same type of cone dystrophy. Some forms of cone dystrophy are inherited; other forms appear to occur spontaneously for no apparent reason (sporadically). Cone dystrophy affects males and females in equal numbers when it occurs sporadically or is inherited as an autosomal dominant or recessive trait. The X-linked recessive form of cone dystrophy only affects males fully, although some females may have mild symptoms of the disorder. The exact incidence of cone dystrophy is unknown and estimates tend to vary in the medical literature. Most sources estimate the incidence as approximately 1 in 30,000 individuals in the general population. Cone dystrophy is usually present in early infancy or during childhood or early adulthood.

Testicular-Cancer,"Testicular cancer is an uncommon form of cancer and accounts for only 1% of all cancers in men. However, it is the most common form of cancer in men between the ages of 15 and 35. Approximately 8,850 men are diagnosed with testicular cancer each year in the United States. A variety of conditions can cause signs and symptoms that are similar to those seen in testicular cancer. This can include testicular torsion, epididymitis, epididymoorchitis, hydrocele, varicocele, hematoma, spermatocele, and syphilitic gumma. Testicular torsion in when a testicle rotates and twists around the spermatic cord (a collection of vessels, nerves, and ducts that runs to and from the testicles). Epididymitis is inflammation of the long, narrow, tightly coiled tube (epididymis) found behind each testicle. The epididymis carries sperm from the testicle to the spermatic duct. Epididymoorchitis is inflammation of the epididymis and the testicles. Hydrocele occurs when fluid builds up in the sac that surrounds the testicle leading to swelling and heaviness or discomfort of the affected testicle. Varicocele is the abnormal enlargement of the veins within the scrotum that can cause a feeling of discomfort or pain and impair fertility. A hematoma is a collection or small mass made up of clotted blood. A spermatocele is a noncancerous (benign) cyst that forms close to a testicle. Syphilitic gumma is a small, growth that can form in some people with syphilis.","epididymitis, varicocele, hematoma, Epididymoorchitis, testicular torsion, syphilitic gumma, cancer, syphilis, hydrocele, epididymoorchitis, Varicocele, Testicular torsion, Hydrocele, Epididymitis, spermatocele",DISEASE

The diagnosis can usually be made by the history and characteristic findings on examination. The important findings are decreased ability to feel light touch in a skin spot, enlarged or tender nerves in the arms or legs, numbness in a hand or foot, and finding the bacteria in the skin. There may also be loss of hair in the affected skin areas. A special type of skin smear is commonly done and will demonstrate the bacteria in the skin in lepromatous and borderline lepromatous cases.

Oculocerebrocutaneous-Syndrome,"Oculocerebrocutaneous (OCC) syndrome (OMIM 164180), a rare genetic disorder, is apparent at birth (congenital). The disorder is characterized primarily by eye (ocular), brain (e.g., cerebral), and skin (cutaneous) malformations. For example, many affected infants have semisolid or fluid-filled swellings (cysts) within the cavities of the skull (orbits) that accommodate the eyeballs and associated structures. In most patients, the eye on the affected side or sides is also abnormally small (microphthalmos). Brain abnormalities associated with OCC syndrome may include enlargement of the ventricular system, multiple fluid-filled spaces within and malformations of the outer region of the cerebral hemispheres (cerebral cortex), absence of the band of nerve fibers that joins the brain's hemispheres (agenesis of the corpus callosum), and a typical malformation of mid- and hindbrain. Affected infants and children often have intellectual disability and episodes of uncontrolled electrical activity in the brain (seizures). In addition, OCC syndrome is characterized by underdevelopment or absence of skin in certain localized regions (focal dermal hypoplasia or aplasia) and most have protruding, flesh-colored or brownish outgrowths of skin (cutaneous tags) within certain facial areas, including around the eyelids, on the cheeks, or near the ears. In all individuals with OCC syndrome known so far, the disorder occurs sporadically (with no family history of similar disorders). OCC syndrome has been reported more frequently in males than in females; however, the prevalence is unknown.

According to reports in the medical literature, common findings include diminished muscle tone (hypotonia) and motor incoordination; an unsteady manner of walking (gait); pronounced verbal delays; and/or certain malformations of the skull and facial (craniofacial) region. Such craniofacial abnormalities may include an unusually small head (microcephaly); vertical skin folds that may cover the eyes' inner corners (epicanthal folds); unusually large ears; and/or other malformations. Chromosome 22 Ring is usually caused by spontaneous or ""de novo"" errors very early in the development of the embryo that appear to occur randomly for unknown reasons.

Other symptoms may include mental retardation, speech problems, bone deformities of the arms and legs, and/or seizures. The exact cause of Pallister W syndrome is not known. Pallister W syndrome is apparent at birth.  It is characterized by widely spaced eyes (hypertelorism) with downward slanting eyelid folds (palpebral fissures), a broad flat nasal bridge, a broad tip of the nose, a broad flat jaw, central clefting of the palate or upper lip, seizures, and mental retardation.  There may also be bone abnormalities in the arms and legs such as abnormal deviation of the elbow away from the body when the arm is extended (cubitus valgus).  Other symptoms may include hair that does not lie flat on the head (cowlick), missing teeth (partial adontia), broad uvula, and a high broad forehead.  Additional findings may include tremor and/or involuntary muscle contractions (i.e., spasticity). Pallister W syndrome is a very rare disorder.  As of  the year 2000, only six cases had been reported in the medical literature.  More than half involved male infants but the numbers are not large enough to draw any conclusions regarding whether it affects one sex more than the other. The characteristic facial features assist in the diagnosis.","genetic disorder, mental retardation",DISEASE
Horner_s-Syndrome,"Horner syndrome is a relatively rare disorder characterized by a constricted pupil (miosis), drooping of the upper eyelid (ptosis), absence of sweating of the face (anhidrosis), and sinking of the eyeball into the bony cavity that protects the eye (enophthalmos). These are the four classic signs of the disorder. Horner syndrome is a rare disorder that affects males and females in equal numbers and may occur at any age, among any ethnic grouping in any geographic location. The diagnosis of Horner syndrome and the localization of the lesions that cause the disorder can be determined by pharmacological tests combined with imaging techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging and ultrasonography of the carotid artery.","anhidrosis, enophthalmos, ptosis",DISEASE
Arthrogryposis-Multiplex-Congenita,"Arthrogryposis is a general or descriptive term for the development of nonprogressive contractures affecting one or more areas of the body prior to birth (congenitally). A contracture is a condition in which a joint becomes permanently fixed in a bent (flexed) or straightened (extended) position, completely or partially restricting the movement of the affected joint. When congenital contractures occur only in one body area, it is not referred to as arthrogryposis but rather an isolated congenital contracture. The most common form of an isolated congenital contracture is clubfoot. When arthrogryposis affects two or more different areas of the body, it may be referred to as arthrogryposis multiplex congenita (AMC). The most common form of AMC is amyoplasia. Arthrogryposis and arthrogryposis multiplex congenita are sometimes used interchangeably. The number of males and females affected by AMC is approximately equal. The condition has been reported in individuals of Asian, African and European descent. Isolated congenital contractures affect approximately 1 in 500 individuals in the general population. AMC affects approximately 1 in 3,000 individuals. AMC is, by definition, present at birth (congenital). A diagnosis of AMC is made based upon identification of characteristic symptoms (e.g., multiple congenital contractures), a detailed patient history, and a thorough clinical evaluation. Certain tests may be necessary to determine the underlying cause of AMC including nerve conduction, electromyography and muscle biopsy, which can help diagnose neuropathic or myopathic disorders. A nerve conduction study measures how rapidly nerves carry an electrical impulse. An electromyography is a test that records electrical activity in skeletal voluntary muscles at rest and during muscle contraction. A biopsy is a procedure in which a small amount of affected tissue (e.g., muscle) is removed and studied under a microscopic to detect characteristic changes or findings that can aid in obtaining a diagnosis. Imaging studies of the central nervous system (CNS) and comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) array, microarray, and exome studies may also be useful studies in making diagnoses. Because of the many mutations that can lead to arthrogryposis, whole genome sequencing is often required (preferable in both parents for comparison as well) to make a diagnosis.","isolated congenital contracture, clubfoot, Arthrogryposis, neuropathic disorders, Isolated congenital contractures, myopathic disorders, arthrogryposis",DISEASE
Glycogen-Storage-Disease-Type-VII,"Glycogen storage diseases are a group of disorders in which stored glycogen cannot be metabolized into glucose to supply energy for the body. Glycogen storage disease type VII (GSD VII) is characterized by weakness, pain and stiffness during exercise.  GSD VII is caused by abnormalities in the muscle phosphofructokinase gene that results in a deficiency of the phosphofructokinase enzyme. This enzyme deficiency leads to a reduced amount of energy available to muscles during exercise.  GSD VII is inherited as an autosomal recessive genetic disorder. GSD type VII usually begins in childhood and is characterized by weakness, pain and stiffness during exercise, sometimes associated with nausea and vomiting and dark, burgundy-colored urine due to the presence of myoglobin (myoglobinuria).  Destruction of muscle tissue (rhabdomyolysis) can also occur.  A rare form of GSD type VII has been reported in infants that is associated with progressive loss of muscle tone (hypotonia), muscle weakness and death.  A late-onset form has been reported in adults who experience only muscle weakness. Glycogen storage disease type VII is a rare disorder that occurs more often in individuals of Japanese and Ashkenazi Jewish descent.  GSD type VII affects males and females in equal numbers. GSD type VII is diagnosed by a muscle biopsy for measurement of the phosphofructokinase enzyme level or measurement of the phosphofructokinase enzyme level in red blood cells. Molecular genetic testing for the phosphofructokinase gene mutations prevalent in the Ashkenazi Jewish population are available on a research basis.","autosomal recessive genetic disorder, myoglobinuria",DISEASE
Hypohidrotic-Ectodermal-Dysplasia,"Hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia (HED) is a rare inherited multisystem disorder that belongs to the group of diseases known as ectodermal dysplasias. Ectodermal dysplasias typically affect the hair, teeth, nails, sweat glands, and/or skin. HED is primarily characterized by partial or complete absence of certain sweat glands (eccrine glands), causing lack of or diminished sweating (anhidrosis or hypohidrosis), heat intolerance, and fever; abnormally sparse hair (hypotrichosis), and absence (hypodontia) and/or malformation of certain teeth. Many individuals with HED also have characteristic facial abnormalities including a prominent forehead, a sunken nasal bridge (so-called ""saddle nose""), unusually thick lips, and/or a large chin. The skin on most of the body may be abnormally thin, dry, and soft with an abnormal lack of pigmentation (hypopigmentation). However, the skin around the eyes (periorbital) may be darkly pigmented (hyperpigmentation) and finely wrinkled, appearing prematurely aged. In many cases, affected infants and children may also exhibit underdevelopment (hypoplasia) or absence (aplasia) of mucous glands within the respiratory and gastrointestinal (GI) tracts and, in some cases, decreased function of certain components of the immune system (e.g., depressed lymphocyte function, and rarely cellular immune hypofunction), potentially causing an increased susceptibility to certain infections and/or allergic conditions. Many affected infants and children experience recurrent attacks of wheezing and breathlessness (asthma), respiratory infections; chronic inflammation of the nasal passages (atrophic rhinitis), scaling, itchy (pruritic) skin rashes (eczema), and/or other findings.","inherited multisystem disorder, eczema",DISEASE
Blepharophimosis-Ptosis-Epicanthus-Inversus-Syndrome,"The four major features that are characteristic symptoms of BPES are present at birth: narrowing of the eye opening (blepharophimosis), droopy eyelids (ptosis), formation of an upward fold of the inner lower eyelid (epicanthus inversus) and increased distance between the eyes (telecanthus). There are two types of BPES, BPES type I and type II, which are both characterized by the typical eyelid malformation. However, BPES type I is also associated with loss of ovarian function or premature ovarian insufficiency (POI). Menstrual periods in women with POI become less frequent over time and stop before the age of 40 thus leading to either difficulty (subfertility) or inability to conceive (infertility).  Other minor facial features frequently observed in both types include “lazy” eye (amblyopia), crossed eyes (strabismus), low-set ears, a short distance between the upper lip and nose, and a broad nasal bridge. The prevalence of BPES is unknown, but there are no differences in prevalence based on ethnicity, sex, race or age.","infertility, amblyopia, blepharophimosis, POI, strabismus, premature ovarian insufficiency, ptosis",DISEASE
Hereditary-Angioedema,"Hereditary angioedema is a rare disorder that affects males and females in equal numbers. Symptoms typically begin in early childhood. An estimated one in 50,000 to 150,000 individuals is affected by this disorder worldwide. The diagnosis of hereditary angioedema is made by a thorough clinical evaluation, a detailed patient history, and blood tests that detect decreased levels of complement proteins. In instances of high clinical suspicion and recurrent episodic angioedema of uncertain etiology, genetic testing is indicated.",angioedema,DISEASE
Myotonia-Congenita,"Myotonia congenita is a rare genetic disorder in which an abnormality of voluntary (skeletal) muscle fiber membranes causes an unusually exaggerated response to stimulation (hyperexcitability). As a result, affected individuals have difficulty relaxing certain muscles after contracting them (myotonia), muscle stiffness (rigidity), and associated symptoms. Such symptoms tend to occur when attempting to move certain muscles after rest. In many cases, individuals with myotonia congenita also have abnormal enlargement of the muscles (hypertrophy), resulting in a ""herculean"" or ""body-builder like"" appearance.",genetic disorder,DISEASE
Adams-Oliver-Syndrome,"Adams-Oliver syndrome (AOS) is an extremely rare inherited disorder characterized by defects of the scalp and abnormalities of the fingers, toes, arms, and/or legs. The physical abnormalities associated with this disorder vary greatly among affected individuals. Some cases may be very mild while others may be severe. In infants with Adams-Oliver syndrome, scalp defects are present at birth (congenital) and may include one or multiple hairless scarred areas that may have abnormally wide (dilated) blood vessels directly under the affected skin. In severe cases, an underlying defect of the bones of the skull may also be present. In addition, infants with this disorder typically have malformations of the hands, arms, feet, and/or legs. These range from abnormally short (hypoplastic) fingers and toes to absent hands and/or lower legs. In some cases, additional abnormalities may also be present. Most cases of AOS appear to follow autosomal dominant inheritance but autosomal recessive inheritance has also been reported. Adams-Oliver syndrome is an extremely rare disorder that appears to affect males and females in equal numbers. More than 125 affected individuals have been reported in the medical literature. The major physical features of Adams-Oliver syndrome (i.e., scalp defects and limb abnormalities) are apparent at birth (congenital). The diagnosis of Adams-Oliver syndrome may be suspected at birth based upon the identification of characteristic scalp and skull defects occurring in association with malformations of the fingers, toes, hands, and/or feet. The diagnosis may be confirmed by a thorough clinical evaluation, a detailed patient history, and a variety of specialized tests, such as advanced imaging techniques. In some cases, it may be possible to detect defects of the skull and/or limbs before birth (prenatally) through the use of advanced imaging techniques such as ultrasound. During fetal ultrasonography, reflected sound waves are used to create an image of the developing fetus.",inherited disorder,DISEASE
Hyperlipoproteinemia-Type-III,"Hyperlipoproteinemia type III is a genetic disorder that causes the body to breakdown (metabolize) fats (lipids) incorrectly. This results in the buildup of lipids in the body (hyperlipidemia) and can lead to the development of multiple small, yellow skin growths (xanthomas). Affected individuals may also develop the buildup of fatty materials in the blood vessels (atherosclerosis) blocking blood flow and potentially leading to heart attack or stroke. Hyperlipoproteinemia type III affects 1-5,000 to 1 in 10,000 people in the general population. Without treatment, affected individuals are 5-10 times more likely to develop cardiovascular disease.","atherosclerosis, stroke, genetic disorder, heart attack, cardiovascular disease",DISEASE
Oculocerebral-Syndrome-with-Hypopigmentation,"Oculocerebral Syndrome with Hypopigmentation is an extremely rare inherited disorder characterized by the lack of normal color (hypopigmentation) of the skin and hair and abnormalities of the central nervous system that affect the eyes and certain parts of the brain (oculocerebral). Physical findings at birth include unusually light skin color and silvery-gray hair. Abnormal findings associated with the central nervous system may include abnormal smallness of one or both eyes (microphthalmia); clouding (opacities) of the front, clear portion of the eye through which light passes (cornea); and/or rapid, involuntary eye movements (nystagmus). Additional symptoms that may develop during infancy include involuntary muscle contractions, associated loss of muscle function (spastic paraplegia), developmental delays, and/or mental retardation.

Kearns-Sayre-Syndrome,"Kearns-Sayre syndrome (KSS) is a rare neuromuscular disorder.  An important clinical symptomatic feature is the presence of a mono-or bilateral ptosis (partial closure of the eyelids). This disease is mostly characterized by three primary findings: progressive paralysis of certain eye muscles (chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia [CPEO]); abnormal accumulation of colored (pigmented) material on the nerve-rich membrane lining the eyes (atypical retinitis pigmentosa), leading to chronic inflammation, progressive degeneration, and wearing-away of certain eye structures (pigmentary degeneration of the retina); and heart disease (cardiomyopathy) such as heart block. Other findings may include muscle weakness, short stature, hearing loss, and/or the loss of ability to coordinate voluntary movements (ataxia) due to problems affecting part of the brain (cerebellum). In some cases, KSS may be associated with other disorders and/or conditions.","cardiomyopathy, neuromuscular disorder, ptosis",DISEASE
Functional-Neurological-Disorder,"Functional neurological disorder (FND) is a medical condition in which there is a problem with the functioning of the nervous system and how the brain and body sends and/or receives signals, rather than a structural disease process such as multiple sclerosis or stroke.

Rapid,"Rapid-onset obesity with hypothalamic dysfunction, hypoventilation, and autonomic dysregulation (ROHHAD) is a rare disorder of respiratory control and autonomic nervous system (ANS) regulation, with endocrine system abnormalities. Respiratory control is the automatic function of breathing in response to varied activities of daily living (ex. exercise, sleep, eating), so within the context of the ANS. The ANS is the portion of the nervous system that controls or regulates many involuntary body functions including heart rate, blood pressure, temperature regulation, bowel and bladder control, breathing, and more. The endocrine system is regulated by the hypothalamus, and through hormones it controls growth, energy and water balance, sexual maturation and fertility as well as response to stress. The diagnosis of ROHHAD is currently based on clinical criteria and though investigation of genetic mutations is underway, no specific cause for ROHHAD has been found to date. ROHHAD is a very rare disorder with approximately 100 cases reported in the literature and clinically to date. Though first described under a different name in 1965, it was not re-named until 2007 nor shown to be distinct from CCHS (documented absence of CCHS-related PHOX2B mutations). Therefore, as ROHHAD is a relatively “new” disorder without many cases identified thus far, it is not yet clear if any certain population is at greater risk for developing ROHHAD.  Because of the explosion of exogenous obesity worldwide, a very high level of vigilance in consideration of ROHHAD is essential. Congenital central hypoventilation syndrome (CCHS) is a disorder of the ANS caused by a gene mutation in the PHOX2B gene that affects the embryologic development of the ANS. Similar to ROHHAD, the “automatic” control of breathing, heart -beat, digestion, and other features of ANSD are among the affected features. In CCHS, the hallmark is hypoventilation while sleeping and, in severe cases, hypoventilation while awake and asleep – despite anatomically normal heart, lung, and airways. Both CCHS and ROHHAD fall within the rubric of respiratory and autonomic disorders of infancy, childhood, and adulthood (RADICA). CCHS is a rare disorder with approximately 1,000 cases described worldwide.  Numbers of reported CCHS cases continue to grow, likely because of increased awareness and introduction of a clinically available genetic test (in 2003) – allowing for early diagnosis and improved treatment. CCHS is often diagnosed in the newborn period because of breathing problems, but milder forms of CCHS may go undiagnosed through infancy, childhood, and even adulthood. A simple blood test can be done to look for a PHOX2B gene mutation (PHOX2B is the disease-defining gene for CCHS). Different types of mutations can occur in this gene which will determine how severely an individual with CCHS is affected. Stepwise testing for PHOX2B mutations should be done with close involvement by a physician and genetic counselor.

Chromosome-7-Partial-Monosomy-7p,"Chromosome 7, Partial Monosomy 7p is a rare chromosomal disorder characterized by deletion (monosomy) of a portion of the short arm (p) of chromosome 7 (7p). Associated symptoms and findings may be variable and may depend on the specific size and location of the deleted segment of 7p. However, in many cases, there is early closure of the fibrous joints (cranial sutures) between certain bones of the skull (craniosynostosis), resulting in an abnormally shaped head. For example, depending on the specific sutures involved, the forehead may appear unusually ""triangular shaped"" (trigonocephaly) or the head may seem abnormally long and narrow with the top pointed or conical (turricephaly). Affected infants and children may also have additional malformations of the skull and facial (craniofacial) region. Such abnormalities may include an unusually small head (microcephaly), closely or widely set eyes (ocular hypotelorism or hypertelorism), downslanting eyelid folds (palpebral fissures), and/or other findings. Chromosome 7, Partial Monosomy 7p is a rare chromosomal disorder that appears to affect males and females in relatively equal numbers.  More than 30 cases have been reported in the medical literature. Additional chromosomal disorders may be characterized by symptoms and findings similar to those associated with Chromosome 7, Partial Monosomy 7p.  Chromosomal testing is necessary to confirm the specific chromosomal abnormality present.

Osteosarcoma,"Osteosarcoma is a form of cancer. It is a type of tumor that affects the bones. Osteosarcoma can affect people at any age, but is most common during the teen-aged years, and is the most common bone cancer affecting children and adolescents under the age of 20. The long bones of the legs, usually near where they connect to the knees, and the upper long bone of the arms, near where this bone meets the shoulders are the most common sites for osteosarcoma formation. Symptoms will vary depending upon the exact location and extent of disease. Pain is the most common symptom of osteosarcoma and there is often a mass or bump that can be felt (palpable). Eighty percent of individuals present with localized disease, which means the cancer remains in the area it first developed. Osteosarcoma can spread (metastasize) to other areas of the body, most likely the lungs. The exact cause is unknown in most individuals, but osteosarcoma can be induced by radiation. Most individuals are treated with a combination of chemotherapy and surgery. Sometimes, radiation therapy may be used. There are estimated to be about 750-1,000 new individuals diagnosed with osteosarcoma each year in the United States. About 450 of those are children or adolescents under the age of 20. Osteosarcoma is a rare disorder, but it is the most common cause of bone cancer in children and adolescents. These tumors usually affect individuals in their second decade of life (10-19 years of age), most often between 13 and 16 years of age, which most likely coincides with adolescent growth spurts. There is a second increase in the number of people with osteosarcoma in people over the age of 60. Overall, osteosarcoma accounts for about 1% of all cancers diagnosed each year in the United States. Osteosarcoma affect slightly more males than females and is slightly more common in African-Americans and Hispanics/Latinos than in Caucasians.","bone cancer, cancer",DISEASE
Acquired-Lipodystrophy,"Acquired lipodystrophy is a general term for types of lipodystrophy that are not inherited, but rather acquired at some point during life. Acquired lipodystrophies do not have a direct genetic cause, but rather many different factors may be involved. Acquired lipodystrophies can be caused by medications, autoimmunity or for unknown reasons (idiopathic). Subtypes of acquired lipodystrophy include acquired generalized lipodystrophy (Lawrence syndrome), acquired partial lipodystrophy (Barraquer-Simons syndrome), localized lipodystrophy, and high active antiretroviral induced lipodystrophy, which may develop in HIV-infected individuals undergoing a specific form of treatment. Onset of acquired forms of lipodystrophy can occur during childhood, adolescence or adulthood. Affected individuals develop characteristic loss of body fat (adipose tissue) affecting specific areas of the body, especially the arms, legs, face, neck, and chest or thoracic regions. In some cases, metabolic complications associated with insulin resistance can develop. Such complications include an inability to break down glucose (glucose intolerance), elevated levels of triglycerides (a type of fat) in the blood (hypertriglyceridemia), and diabetes. Additional symptoms such as fat accumulation in the liver (fatty liver or hepatic steatosis) may also occur. AGL and APL generally affect women more than men, although this may be due in part to ascertainment bias because women tend to be more severely affected and more easily recognized. APL has been reported in approximately 250 individuals with a male to female ratio of 1:4. It has been reported in individuals of various different ethnicities. AGL has been reported in approximately 100 individuals with a male to female ratio of 1:3. Most cases have been reported in Caucasians.

X-linked-Lymphoproliferative-Syndrome,"X-linked lymphoproliferative (XLP) syndrome is an extremely rare inherited (primary) immunodeficiency disorder characterized by a defective immune system that is powerfully responsive to infection with the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). This virus is common among the general population and is relatively well-known because it is the cause of infectious mononucleosis (IM), usually with no long-lasting effects. However, in individuals with XLP, exposure to EBV may result in severe, life-threatening fulminant hepatitis; abnormally low levels of antibodies in the blood and body secretions (hypogammaglobulinemia), resulting in increased susceptibility to various infections; malignancies of certain types of lymphoid tissue (B-cell lymphomas); and/or other abnormalities. The range of symptoms and findings associated with XLP may vary considerably from case to case. In addition, the range of effects may change in an affected individual over time. In most cases, individuals with XLP experience an onset of symptoms anytime from ages about 6 months to 10 years of age. X-linked lymphoproliferative syndrome is an extremely rare disorder that is usually fully expressed in males only.  About 400± cases affecting males in more than 80 multigenerational families (kindreds) from several different countries have been reported in the medical literature.

The most common feature of the syndrome is the passing of blood in the urine (hematuria). Renal cell carcinoma is more common in males than in females (ratio of 2 or 3 to 1) and in persons with a history of smoking.  It is also more common in persons with other types of kidney disorders and tends to run in some families.  Renal cell carcinoma accounts for approximately 30,000 new cases of kidney malignancies per year in the United States.

Additionally, the position of the heart chambers as well as the visceral organs such as the liver and spleen is reversed (situs inversus). However, most affected individuals can live a normal life without associated symptoms or disability. Electrocardiography reveals an inversion of the electrical waves from the heart and is the diagnostic measure of choice. Dextrocardia with Situs Inversus is present at birth.  The condition affects males and females in equal numbers. Treatment of Dextrocardia with Situs Inversus is symptomatic and supportive when needed.

Appendiceal-Cancer-and-Tumors,"Appendiceal cancer is very rare with approximately 1-2 cases per 1 million individuals. Appendiceal cancers can occur at any age, with the peak occurrence in the 6th decade (average age of 50 at diagnosis). Most studies report that men and women are affected in equal numbers, while a few have suggested a slightly increased frequency in women. Peritoneal carcinomatosis is the spread and growth of cancer cells in the abdominal cavity. Cancers that are most frequently associated with peritoneal carcinomatosis include the gastrointestinal (colon, rectal, appendiceal, gastric, pancreas, small bowel and gallbladder) and the gynecologic (ovarian, primary peritoneal, and uterine) cancers. Other cancers that can spread to the abdominal cavity include breast, esophagus, and melanoma. Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) are a subtype of sarcoma of the intestine that can also present with multiple cancer tumors in the abdomen. Peritoneal mesothelioma is a cancer that originates in the lining of the abdominal cavity (peritoneum) and presents with signs and symptoms of peritoneal carcinomatosis. Because there are no unique features of appendiceal cancer on imaging studies such as ultrasound, CT scan, PET scan or MRI, the actual diagnosis of appendiceal cancer cannot be made until a tumor specimen is examined by a pathologist. This is frequently accomplished at the time of appendectomy for appendicitis, surgery for an intestinal blockage or presumed ovarian cancer, or through a diagnostic tumor biopsy performed for an abnormal clinical or radiographic finding such as a palpable tumor or tumors seen on an imaging study. The finding of a dilated, mucin filled appendix on CT scan or MRI should prompt concern for an appendiceal tumor and an appendectomy should be considered. The different types of appendiceal tumors and cancers can be distinguished by the appearance of the cells under the microscope and by staining them for specific markers. Goblet cell carcinoid tumors tend to be easier to identify because of the unique combination of neuroendocrine and epithelial cells.","Cancers, appendicitis, gastrointestinal cancers, cancer, intestinal blockage, melanoma, gynecologic cancers, cancers",DISEASE
OSMED-Heterozygous,"Heterozygous OSMED (oto-spondyl-megaepiphyseal dysplasia) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by skeletal malformations resulting in shortening of the upper limbs and thighs and short stature (rhizomelic dwarfism). Additional symptoms include distinctive facial features and delays in psychomotor development. After the initial period of growth deficiency, affected individuals experience gradual improvement in bone growth that leads to normal physical development by early childhood. Mental and motor development is also normal by early childhood. In some cases, affected individuals develop hearing loss. Heterozygous OSMED occurs because of disruptions or changes (mutations) to the COL11A2 gene. A diagnosis of heterozygous OSMED is made based upon a thorough clinical evaluation, a detailed patient history, identification of characteristic symptoms, and a variety of specialized tests including x-rays. X-ray studies reveal characteristic skeletal malformations associated with heterozygous OSMED.",genetic disorder,DISEASE
Acidemia-Isovaleric,"Isovaleric Acidemia is a hereditary metabolic disorder. It is characterized by a deficiency of the enzyme isovaleryl CoA dehydrogenase. The disorder occurs in both an acute and a chronic intermittent form. In the acute form of Isovaleric Acidemia, vomiting, refusal to eat, and listlessness usually occur. With treatment and low protein diet, the disorder becomes chronically intermittent, and a nearly normal life is possible. Isovaleric Acidemia is a genetic disorder inherited through autosomal  recessive genes.  Symptoms are the result of a deficiency of the enzyme  isovaleric co-enzyme A (CoA) dehydrogenase, which is needed for the breakdown  of the amino acid leucine.  Human traits, including the classic genetic diseases, are the product of the interaction of two genes for that condition, one received from the father and one from the mother.  In recessive disorders, the condition does not appear unless a person inherits the same defective gene for the same trait from each parent.  If an individual receives one normal gene and one gene for the disease, the person will be a carrier for the disease, but generally will not show symptoms of the disorder. The risk of  transmitting the disease to the children of a couple, both of whom are carriers for a recessive disorder, is 25 percent.  On average, fifty percent of their children will be carriers of the disease, while 25 percent will receive a normal copy of the gene from each parent for that trait.  The risks are the same for each pregnancy. Isovaleric Acidemia is a rare disorder affecting males and females in equal numbers, usually beginning during infancy.","genetic disorder, hereditary metabolic disorder, recessive disorders, classic genetic diseases",DISEASE

Trisomy-18-Syndrome,"Trisomy 18 syndrome is a rare chromosomal disorder in which all or a critical region of chromosome 18 appears three times (trisomy) rather than twice in cells of the body. In some cases, the chromosomal abnormality may be present in only a percentage of cells, whereas other cells contain the normal chromosomal pair (mosaicism). Trisomy 18 syndrome was originally known as Edwards syndrome, after one of the investigators (JH Edwards) who initially recognized the condition as a distinct disease entity in 1960.  The syndrome appears to affect females more frequently than males by a ratio of approximately three or four to one. Large population surveys indicate that it occurs in about one in 5,000 to 7,000 live births.  The frequency of trisomy 18 syndrome increases with advancing age of the mother. Reports indicate that the mean maternal age is 32.5 years.","chromosomal disorder, chromosomal abnormality",DISEASE
Scleroderma,"Scleroderma is a rare autoimmune connective tissue disorder characterized by abnormal thickening of the skin. Connective tissue is composed of collagen, which supports and binds other body tissues. There are several types of scleroderma. Some types affect certain, specific parts of the body, while other types can affect the whole body and internal organs (systemic). Scleroderma is also known as progressive systemic sclerosis. The exact cause of scleroderma is unknown. The systemic form of scleroderma is thought to affect from 40,000 to 165,000 people in the United States. The disease is three to four times more common in females than in males. Scleroderma may occur at any age but the symptoms most frequently begin during midlife.",autoimmune connective tissue disorder,DISEASE
Degos-Disease,"Degos disease is an extremely rare disorder in which small and medium sized arteries become blocked (occlusive arteriopathy), restricting the flow of blood to affected areas. Degos disease usually causes characteristic skin lesions that may last for a period of time ranging from weeks to years. In some individuals, Degos disease will be limited to the skin (benign cutaneous Degos disease); other individuals will also develop symptoms affecting other organ systems (systemic Degos disease). Systemic Degos disease is most frequently characterized by lesions in the small intestine, but other organs are also affected. Major symptoms may include abdominal pain, diarrhea, and/or weight loss. The systemic form of Degos disease can cause life-threatening complications such as perforated bowels leading to inflammation of the abdominal cavity (peritonitis). The exact cause of Degos disease is unknown. A diagnosis of Degos disease is made based upon a thorough clinical evaluation, a detailed patient history, identification of characteristic findings (e.g., skin lesions), and microscopic examination of affected skin tissue that reveal distinctive changes to that tissue. Because most tests are normal, no specific laboratory test can be used to aid in the diagnosis of Degos disease.","diarrhea, peritonitis",DISEASE
Dyskeratosis-Congenita,"Dyskeratosis congenita is a rare genetic form of bone marrow failure, the inability of the marrow to produce sufficient blood cells. Dyskeratosis is Latin and means the irreversible degeneration of skin tissue, and congenita means inborn. First described in the medical literature in 1906, dyskeratosis congenita was originally thought to be a skin disease that also affects the nails and the mouth. Only later in the sixties was it realized that patients with these skin changes almost always develop bone marrow failure. Thus, for the last 40 years or so, the bone marrow failure syndrome dyskeratosis congenita was diagnosed when patients presented with the triad of abnormal skin, malformation (dystrophy) of the nails, and white, thickened patches on the mucous membranes of the mouth (oral leukoplakia). The skin changes may be present before the development of bone marrow failure. Bone marrow failure is usually diagnosed by the low number of circulating blood cells including red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. Additional findings in patients with dyskeratosis congenita may include short stature, eye and tooth abnormalities, thin and early graying of the hair, lung (pulmonary) disease, liver disease, gut abnormalities, bone thinning (osteoporosis), infertility, learning difficulties, and delays in reaching developmental milestones. An increased incidence of leukemia and cancer has also been documented. The prevalence or incidence of dyskeratosis congenita is difficult to assess. In a population of patients with bone marrow failure about 2-5% of patients have bone marrow failure due to dyskeratosis congenita. In patients with pulmonary fibrosis similarly 2-5% are thought to be due to mutations in TERC or TERT. In families with an increased frequency of bone marrow failure and/or lung disease, dyskeratosis congenita should be excluded as a possible cause of their disease.","liver disease, bone marrow failure, bone marrow failure syndrome, pulmonary disease, infertility, cancer, pulmonary fibrosis, lung disease, osteoporosis, skin disease",DISEASE
Medullary-Sponge-Kidney,"Medullary Sponge Kidney is a rare disorder characterized by the formation of cystic malformations in the collecting ducts and the tubular structures within the kidneys (tubules) that collect urine. One or both kidneys may be affected. The initial symptoms of this disorder may include blood in the urine (hematuria), calcium stone formation in the kidneys (nephrolithiasis) or infection. The exact cause of Medullary Sponge Kidney is not known. The exact cause of Medullary Sponge Kidney is not known and most cases occur sporadically for no apparent reason.  Some cases are thought to run in families (familial) and may be inherited as an autosomal dominant genetic trait.  However, this inheritance pattern has not been proven.  Some studies have suggested there may be a a possible relationship between overactivity of the parathyroid gland (Hyperparathyroidism) and Medullary Sponge Kidney. Medullary Sponge Kidney is a rare disorder that affects slightly more women than men.  It is thought to occur in 1 in 1,000 to 5,000 people in the United States.  Although the symptoms of Medullary Sponge Kidney may begin at any age, they usually develop during adolescence or in adults between the ages of 30 and 50 years.  Approximately 13 percent of all people who develop kidney stones are eventually diagnosed with Medullary Sponge Kidney. Medullary Sponge Kidney may also develop in people with Beckwith-Wiedemann Syndrome.

Hydrocephalus,"Hydrocephalus is a condition in which abnormally widened (dilated) cerebral spaces in the brain (ventricles) inhibit the normal flow of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The cerebrospinal fluid accumulates in the skull and puts pressure on the brain tissue. An enlarged head in infants and increased cerebrospinal fluid pressure are frequent findings but are not necessary for the diagnosis of Hydrocephalus. There are several different forms of Hydrocephalus: communicating hydrocephalus, non-communicating hydrocephalus or obstructive hydrocephalus, internal hydrocephalus, normal pressure hydrocephalus, and benign hydrocephalus. Most cases of Hydrocephalus are diagnosed in the first 2 years of life, but onset may occur at any age, depending on the cause.  Most types of Hydrocephalus (with the exception of those caused by an X-linked genetic trait) seem to affect males and females equally.","communicating hydrocephalus, obstructive hydrocephalus, Hydrocephalus, benign hydrocephalus, internal hydrocephalus, non-communicating hydrocephalus",DISEASE
Muscular-Dystrophy-Becker,"Becker muscular dystrophy is in the category of inherited muscle wasting diseases caused by a gene abnormality (mutation) that results in deficient or abnormal production of the dystrophin protein (dystrophinopathies). The abnormal gene is called DMD and is located on the X chromosome. Becker muscular dystrophy follows x-linked recessive inheritance so it mostly affects males, but some females are affected. Becker muscular dystrophy usually begins in the teens or early twenties and symptoms vary greatly between affected individuals. Muscle deterioration progresses slowly but usually results in the need for a wheel chair. Muscles of the heart deteriorate (cardiomyopathy) in some affected individuals, and this process can become life-threatening. Learning disabilities involving visual abilities may be present. Becker muscular dystrophy occurs in approximately 1 in 30,000 male births. The diagnosis of Becker muscular dystrophy is based on physical symptoms, family history, an elevated concentration of creatine kinase (CK) in the blood indicating destruction of muscle, and molecular genetic testing. DMD is the only gene that has been associated with Becker muscular dystrophy and many different types of DMD gene mutations have been identified in individuals with this condition. Identification of a DMD gene mutation from molecular genetic testing confirms the diagnosis. If molecular genetic testing is performed and a DMD gene mutation is not found, a skeletal muscle biopsy is recommended to examine the appearance of the dystrophin protein.","inherited muscle wasting diseases, cardiomyopathy",DISEASE
Madelung_s-Disease,"The exact cause of Madelung’s disease is not known. The body’s inability to properly metabolize fat indicates that it may be an endocrine disorder. Some scientists believe a predisposition to the disorder may be inherited and there have been some reports of cases that appear to be familial. However, the mode of transmission in those cases has not been determined. Madelung’s disease most frequently affects middle-aged males. The condition is most common in those who abuse alcohol. However, this disease is also found in women and persons who do not consume alcohol. For reasons that are unclear, the disorder appears to be more prevalent in Europe than in the United States. The diagnosis of Madelung’s disease may involve ultrasound images, CAT scans, or magnetic resonance imaging.",endocrine disorder,DISEASE
Mesenteric-Panniculitis,"The epidemiology of mesenteric panniculitis has not been fully defined. A recent study reported that findings consistent with mesenteric panniculitis occurred in 359 patients (0.24%) from a total of 147,794 abdominal computed tomography (CT) examinations undertaken for over a 5-year period in a large community based medical system. Of these, 100 patients (28%) had known malignancy or were later diagnosed with cancer. In some reports, mesenteric panniculitis has a male predominance of 2:1. Mesenteric panniculitis most often appears during the sixth and seventh decade of life, and its incidence appears to increase with age. Children and adolescents are less commonly affected, possibly related to a lesser amount of fat in their mesentery, but more importantly because of specific characteristics of this form of autoimmunity. Symptoms of the mesenteric panniculitis mimic those of a number of other benign and malignant conditions. Because of this, it is important to rule out other diseases prior to confirming the diagnosis of mesenteric panniculitis. Infectious causes range from viral, bacterial (including V. cholerae) and parasitic infections. There are also a variety of diseases that are associated with mesenteric abnormalities on abdominal imaging. Such conditions include primary or metastatic mesentery cancer, gastrointestinal lymphoma, desmoid tumors, inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis), Crohn’s disease, idiopathic nodular panniculitis, locally advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma, retroperitoneal fibrosis and other sclerotic diseases as mentioned above.","pancreatitis, desmoid tumors, sclerotic diseases, cancer",DISEASE
Kasabach,"Kasabach-Merritt phenomenon (KMP) is a rare condition that is associated with a coagulopathy with features including profound thrombocytopenia (low platelets), hypofibrinogenemia (low fibrinogen), and anemia. This phenomenon is only associated  with two rare vascular tumors: kaposiform hemangioendotheliomas and tufted angiomas.  This condition can be life threatening secondary to the risk of bleeding and progression to DIC (disseminated intravascular coagulopathy). Initially a vascular lesion is noted on the skin which can be firm, indurated and purpuric.  Areas of petechiae (tiny red dots) can appear around the lesion or on other parts of the body.  If the vascular lesion is internal, these petechiae can be seen on the skin.  Bruising and spontaneous bleeding can also occur.  These tumors are not hemangiomas.  They usually present in young infants, less than three months of age, but have rarely been reported in older children.  These tumors occur in the extremities, chest, neck, abdomen and pelvis.  They infiltrate across tissue plans and can be aggravated by interventions, infection and trauma.  When these tumors with KMP are internal such as in the pleural or retroperitoneum, they can cause significant morbidity and mortality.  The morbidity and mortality is caused by bleeding. The cause of Kasabach-Merritt phenomenon is unknown. It is believed to be secondary to sequestration or trapping of platelets into the tumor.  These tumors are made up of abnormal endothelial cells (spindle cells) and also lymphatic malformation.  It is unclear why the KMP occurs and if it is caused by the spindle cells or the lymphatic component. Kasabach-Merritt phenomenon is a rare disorder that affects males and females equally The diagnosis is most often made during infancy but older children have been reported with this phenomenon.  KHE and TA tumors can occur without KMP.  The reason for this is still unknown and may be secondary to a smaller size of the tumor, an older age at presentation or other clinical features. The diagnosis of Kasabach-Merritt phenomenon is based on the diagnosis of Kaposiform hemangioendothelioma/tufted angioma and this coagulopathy as noted above.  If this diagnosis is suspected blood work including a CBC with differential and platelets, fibrinogen, D-dimer, PT, and PTT should be ordered. The best imaging modality to assess the extent of the lesion is a MRI with contrast. A biopsy will confirm the diagnosis.","thrombocytopenia, vascular tumors, disseminated intravascular coagulopathy, anemia, DIC, hemangiomas",DISEASE
Leber-Hereditary-Optic-Neuropathy,"Leber hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON) is mainly characterized by bilateral, painless subacute loss of central vision during young adult life. In most cases, symptoms begin with one eye first, followed a few weeks later by visual failure in the other eye. Extremely rarely there may be neurologic abnormalities, such as peripheral neuropathy, postural tremor, nonspecific myopathy, and movement disorders. LHON is caused by mutations in mitochondrial DNA and it is transmitted by maternal inheritance. LHON affects approximately 1:50,000 people. Many carriers never suffer significant visual loss; males are about four to five times more likely than females to be affected. LHON affects both males and females and can only be inherited from a female. The birth prevalence of LHON is approximately 1 in 50,000 people. LHON is diagnosed based on ophthalmologic findings, which include specialized visual testing. The testing involves dilated fundus examination to identify characteristic changes in the optic disc and vascular changes during the acute phase, electrophysiologic studies, and neuroimaging. Molecular genetic testing for mitochondrial genes associated with LHON can be used to confirm diagnosis. Most affected individuals know if their family members also are affected by LHON.","peripheral neuropathy, myopathy",DISEASE
Ichthyosis-Netherton-Syndrome,"Netherton syndrome is a rare hereditary disorder characterized by scaling skin, hair anomalies, increased susceptibility to atopic eczema (a skin condition that can result in dry, red and flaky skin), elevated IgE levels, and other related symptoms. Netherton syndrome is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. Netherton syndrome is a rare hereditary disorder.

Congenital-Syphilis,"Congenital syphilis is a chronic infectious disease caused by the spirochete treponema pallidum and transmitted by an infected mother to the fetus in the womb. Adults transmit syphilis through sexual contact. (For information on syphilis in adults choose “Syphilis” as your search term in the Rare Disease Database). In 1998, the National Syphilis Elimination Plan went into effect. One of the goals of this plan was to reduce the incidence of congenital syphilis (CS) to fewer than 40 cases per 100,000 live births. The incidence of congenital syphilis in newborns under a year old rose in the United States from 180 cases in 1957 to 422 cases in 1972. More recently there has been a dramatic increase of congenital syphilis, especially in urban areas, that has been attributed in part to crack cocaine use. In the year 2000, the incidence rate was about 13.4 per 100,000 live births, which represented about 529 cases. The diagnosis of CS may be delayed because the symptoms are not always evident. However, any child of a mother infected with syphilis should be suspected for congenital syphilis. If the signs and symptoms are not obviously those of CS, then further testing will be required, including (1) the examination of blood samples for antibodies to the spirochete infection and (2) identification of the syphilis bacterium under a light microscope.",chronic infectious disease,DISEASE
Restless-Legs-Syndrome,"Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a neurologic and sleep related movement disorder characterized by an irresistible urge to move in the legs that typically occurs or worsens at rest. It is usually accompanied by abnormal, uncomfortable sensations, known as paresthesias or dysesthesias, that are often likened to crawling, cramping, aching, burning, itching, or prickling deep within the affected areas. Although the legs are usually involved, an urge to move with paresthesias or dysesthesias may also sometimes affect the arms or other areas of the body. Those with RLS may vigorously move the affected area, engage in pacing, or perform other, often repetitive movements, such as stretching, bending, or rocking. Symptoms typically worsen in the evening or at night, often resulting in sleep disturbances. Some individuals with RLS may also develop symptoms during other extended periods of inactivity, such as while sitting in a movie theater or traveling in a car. RLS may occur as a primary condition or due to another underlying disorder, certain medications, or other factors (secondary or symptomatic RLS). In primary RLS, the disorder is often genetic in origin or occurs for unknown reasons (idiopathic). Secondary RLS may occur in association with certain conditions, such as iron deficiency, low levels of the oxygen-carrying component of red blood cells (anemia), kidney failure, or pregnancy. Restless legs syndrome appears to be about twice as common in women than men. Associated symptoms may become apparent at any age, and the disorder is usually chronic, often becoming more severe with increasing age. However, in some affected individuals, RLS symptoms may periodically subside and recur with varying levels of severity. According to some reports, although most individuals do not bring their symptoms to the attention of physicians until middle age, up to 40 percent may initially experience symptoms before age 20. The diagnosis of restless legs syndrome (RLS) is based upon a thorough clinical evaluation; a complete patient history, including current medications; family history; and specialized tests. In addition, a clinical assessment scale may be used to help evaluate severity of the disorder. Various laboratory studies may be conducted to help detect or rule out possible associated conditions, including tests to measure iron and ferritin levels in the blood to assess iron stores in the body. In addition, a neurological examination may be conducted if associated neurological abnormalities are suspected (e.g., peripheral neuropathy). In addition, some physicians may recommend specialized sleep studies to evaluate sleep disturbances and possible PLMS, but sleep studies are not needed to diagnose uncomplicated RLS.","symptomatic RLS, restless legs syndrome, neurologic and sleep related movement disorder, anemia, kidney failure, secondary RLS, RLS, Restless legs syndrome, iron deficiency, peripheral neuropathy, PLMS",DISEASE
Dandy-Walker-Malformation,"Dandy-Walker malformation (DWM) is a brain malformation that occurs during embryonic development of the cerebellum and 4th ventricle. The cerebellum is the area of the brain that helps coordinate movement, and is also involved with cognition and behavior. The 4th ventricle is a space around the cerebellum that channels fluid from inside to around the outside of the brain. DWM is characterized by underdevelopment (small size and abnormal position) of the middle part of the cerebellum known as the cerebellar vermis, cystic enlargement of the 4th ventricle and enlargement of the base of the skull (posterior fossa). DWM is sometimes (20-80%) associated with hydrocephalus, in which blockage of the normal flow of spinal fluid leads to excessive amounts of fluid accumulating in and around the brain. This leads to abnormally high pressure within the skull and swelling of the head, and can lead to neurological impairment. DWM results from defects in early embryonic development of the cerebellum and surrounding structures.  A few patients have chromosome abnormalities including deletion of chromosome 3q24.3 (the location of the first DWM genes, known as ZIC1 and ZIC4), 6p25 or 13q32.2-q33.2, or duplication of 9p.  In the remainder, it is probably due to other more complex genetic and perhaps environmental factors (teratogens) as the recurrence risk in siblings less than 5%.  A few examples of affected siblings with isolated Dandy-Walker malformation have been reported, suggesting autosomal recessive or X-linked inheritance, but most of these are probably CVH and not typical DWM.  In these families, the recurrence risk is higher, up to 25%.  DWM may also occur as part of a genetic syndrome that includes multiple birth defects, such as the PHACES syndrome of facial hemangioma, heart and sternal defects and DWM.  Many other syndromes and chromosome abnormalities have been reported with DWM, but most of these appear to have CVH rather than typical DWM. The frequency of Dandy Walker malformation in the US is approximately 1 per 25,000 -35,000 live births and affects more females than males. Dandy Walker malformation is diagnosed with the use of ultrasound, CT and MRI. Prenatal diagnosis of Dandy-Walker malformation is sometimes made by ultrasound or fetal MRI.","hydrocephalus, brain malformation, genetic syndrome",DISEASE
X,"X-linked myopathy with excessive autophagy (XMEA) is an extremely rare genetic disorder characterized by muscle disease (myopathy). The disorder is fully expressed in males only and is characterized by slowly progressive muscle weakness, especially in the legs. Onset is usually during childhood often between 5-10 years of age. XMEA occurs due to mutations of an unidentified gene on the X chromosome. The disorder is inherited an X-linked recessive trait. A diagnosis of XMEA is made based upon a thorough clinical evaluation, a detailed patient history and surgical removal and microscopic evaluation (biopsy) of affected muscle tissue.","genetic disorder, myopathy",DISEASE
Amelogenesis-Imperfecta,"Amelogenesis imperfecta (AI) refers to a group of rare, inherited disorders characterized by abnormal enamel formation. The term is typically restricted to those disorders of enamel development not associated with other abnormalities of the body. AI affects 1 of 14,000 to 16,000 children in the United States. Of this number, about 40% have the hypocalcified dominant type. The autosomal dominant and recessive forms of the disorder affect males and females in equal numbers. The X-linked dominant type of the disorder affects twice as many males as females. The X-linked recessive type affects only males. Diagnosis of AI is usually made by visual examination, family history and X-ray examination at the time teeth erupt. The dentist may use a simple hand instrument to distinguish the different types of AI. By one to two years of age, the diagnosis can be made.",inherited disorders,DISEASE
Froelich-Syndrome,"Froehlich syndrome, also known as adiposogenital dystrophy, is a constellation of endocrine abnormalities believed to result from damage to the hypothalamus, a part of the brain that links the nervous system to the endocrine system via the pituitary gland.  The hypothalamus regulates sleep cycles and body temperature and composition while stimulating the pituitary gland to release a variety of hormones that control growth, metabolism, and body development. Thus, numerous pituitary gland hormones could be indirectly disrupted by damage to the hypothalamus. Unlike similar diseases such as Prader-Willi syndrome, Froehlich syndrome is acquired, not inherited, and is associated with tumors of the hypothalamus area or their surgical treatment, causing increased appetite and depressed secretion of gonadotropin. This syndrome affects males more often than females. Froehlich syndrome is characterized by increased or excessive eating that leads to obesity, small testes, and a delay in the onset of puberty. It is also common for children with Froehlich syndrome to experience the delay in physical growth and the development of secondary sexual characteristics. In addition to delayed growth and puberty, children with this syndrome tend to be short in stature. As a result of tumor growth, some children with Froehlich syndrome may also develop intellectual difficulties, poor vision – due optic nerve damage-, somnolence, and diabetes insipidus –  known as Infundibulo-tuberal syndrome (Froehlich+somnolence+diabetes insipidus), lower than normal body temperature (hypothermia) and very delicate skin. Froehlich syndrome is a very rare condition that affects more males than females.","obesity, diabetes insipidus, tumors of the hypothalamus, endocrine abnormalities",DISEASE
Tardive-Dyskinesia,"Tardive dyskinesia is characterized by involuntary and abnormal movements of the jaw, lips and tongue. Typical symptoms include facial grimacing, sticking out the tongue, sucking or fish-like movements of the mouth. In some cases, the arms and/or legs may also be affected by involuntary rapid, jerking movements (chorea), or slow, writhing movements (athetosis). Symptoms of tardive dystonia include slower, twisting movements of larger muscles of the neck and trunk as well as the face. Tardive dyskinesia is caused by long-term use of a class of drugs known as neuroleptics. Neuroleptic drugs are often prescribed for management of certain mental, neurological, or gastrointestinal disorders. Metoclopramide and prochlorperazine are drugs used for chronic gastrointestinal conditions that may cause tardive dyskinesia. Neuroleptic drugs block dopamine receptors in the brain. Dopamine is a neurotransmitter which is a chemical that helps brain cells to communicate. Although most cases occur after a person has taken these drugs for several years, some cases may occur with shorter use of neuroleptic drugs. Tardive dyskinesia affects individuals who have been taking neuroleptic drugs for a long period of time. A high percentage of schizophrenic people who have spent long periods of time taking these drugs have a high risk of developing TD. However, neuroleptic drugs are also prescribed for depression, some digestive disorders, and other neurologic illnesses.","digestive disorders, gastrointestinal disorders, neurologic illnesses, chronic gastrointestinal conditions, mental disorders, neurological disorders, depression, chorea",DISEASE
Hereditary-Breast-and-Ovarian-Cancer-Syndrome,"HBOC syndrome can affect both men and women and occurs in people from all ethnic and racial backgrounds. In fact, HBOC syndrome is the most common cause of hereditary breast and ovarian cancer in all ethnic and racial backgrounds. The prevalence, which is the number of people with a disorder at a given time, is not known, but estimated to be somewhere between 1 in 200 to 1 in 800 people in the general population. In certain populations, the prevalence is higher. In individuals of Ashkenazi Jewish descent, HBOC syndrome affects about 1 in 40 people. Sometimes, this is due to a founder effect. A founder effect is when a small, isolated population of people expands over several generations leading to a high prevalence of a genetic trait.","hereditary ovarian cancer, hereditary breast cancer",DISEASE

It is estimated that approximately 1 percent of people who have venous thrombosis and embolism have congenital antithrombin deficiency. The acquired form of antithrombin deficiency is more prevalent than the congenital form of the disorder. A low blood level of antithrombin suggests that the patient may have antithrombin deficiency. However, it is important to keep in mind that many conditions can lower antithrombin levels (acute clots, heparin therapy, liver or kidney disease, etc.) without the patient having inherited antithrombin deficiency. Repeat testing should be done at a time when the patient is not ill, is not on heparin and does not have related medical problems.","kidney disease, venous thrombosis, liver disease, embolism",DISEASE
Congenital-Pulmonary-Lymphangiectasia,"Congenital pulmonary lymphangiectasia (CPL) is a rare developmental disorder that is present at birth (congenital). Affected infants have abnormally widened (dilated) lymphatic vessels within the lungs. The lymphatic system helps the immune system in protecting the body against infection and disease. It consists of a network of tubular channels (lymph vessels) that drain a thin watery fluid known as lymph from different areas of the body into the bloodstream. Lymph accumulates in the tiny spaces between tissue cells and contains proteins, fats, and certain white blood cells known as lymphocytes. According to some reports CPL occurs more often in males than females. However, the data is not conclusive and CPL may occur in males and females in equal numbers. The exact number of cases of CPL is unknown. In the past, the disorder was associated with high mortality in the newborn period.

Chordoma,"Chordomas can affect individuals of any age, including young children, but most often are diagnosed in individuals between 40-75 years of age (the average age at diagnosis is 55 years). Collectively, chordomas affect males more often than females by a ratio of approximately 2:1. However, skull base tumors have an equal (1:1) gender distribution. Children are more likely to have skull base tumors. Chordomas account for approximately 1-4% of all malignant bone tumors and around 20% of primary tumors of the spinal column. The incidence of chordoma is estimated to be approximately 1 per 1,000,000 people. About 300 new cases of chordoma are diagnosed in the United States each year. Some reports state that these tumors are more common in individuals of European ancestry. Chondrosarcoma is a general term for a type of bone cancer that arises from cartilage cells. Cartilage is the specialized tissue that serves as a buffer or cushion at joints. Most of the skeleton of an embryo consists of cartilage, which is slowly converted into bone. Chondrosarcomas typically affect the arms, legs, and pelvis, but can affect any area that contains cartilage including the skull base and spinal column. Most cases are diagnosed in adults between the ages of 20 and 60. Chondrosarcomas are malignant and may spread to other areas of the body.

Mal-de-Debarquement,"The true cause behind MDD is still unknown.  MDD likely results from the body’s balance system inadequately processing and adapting to multiple sensory inputs (visual, vestibular, proprioceptive and cognitive) from the environment once the stimulus (trigger) has ended.  It is as yet undetermined as to the cause of the balance system’s inability to appropriately compensate and adapt. How or why this happens remains a mystery. The majority of people affected are adult females, although there have been reports of males having the diagnosis. Patients with migraine may have any increased susceptibility through unknown mechanisms. The diagnosis of MDD still remains mostly clinical. As such, the history is very important. Persistent “dizziness” after an ocean cruise, a sailing trip, a prolonged airplane flight or a cross-country road trip is highly suggestive of MDD. Vestibular function tests in patients with MDD have been normal or nonspecific in their abnormality. These tests are important in excluding other etiologies for the patient’s symptoms.",migraine,DISEASE
Sheehan-Syndrome,"Excessive blood loss during or after delivery of a baby may affect the function of the pituitary gland, leading to a form of maternal hypopituitarism known as Sheehan syndrome (SS). Such extensive bleeding may reduce the blood flow to the pituitary gland causing the pituitary cells to be damaged or die (necrosis). Thus, the production of the usual pituitary hormones will be reduced, perhaps by a significant amount. During pregnancy the pituitary gland will enlarge and may double in size. At this time the gland is especially vulnerable to a severe drop in blood pressure (sometimes called ""shock"") and excessive maternal bleeding may induce the ""shock"" and the damage to the cells of the gland. At that time the amount of hormones produced by the pituitary may be decreased giving rise to the symptoms associated with hypopituitarism. There appear to be two forms of the disorder; a chronic form and an acute form, depending on the amount of damage to the gland's cells. The acute form reflects considerable damage so that symptoms become apparent soon after delivery. In chronic cases, the volume of damage is much less and symptoms may not appear for months or years after delivery. Sheehan syndrome affects women with excessive blood loss and circulatory collapse following childbirth. The incidence of Sheehan syndrome is not known. In patients with severe hemorrhaging on delivery accompanied by long-lasting low blood pressure, treatment is started as soon as possible. Women believed to have the chronic form usually have blood drawn and the levels for several hormones are determined.",hypopituitarism,DISEASE
Trisomy-X,"Trisomy X is a chromosomal disorder that affects only females. Reported estimates of frequency have varied with the most common estimate being one in 1,000 female births. Because many females with the disorder may have few or no symptoms, they may never be diagnosed. Researchers believe that the disorder is underdiagnosed and that the reported number of affected females as reflected in the medical literature is inappropriately low.

Guanidinoacetate-Methyltransferase-Deficiency,"The severity of GAMT varies from patient to patient. Global developmental delays affect all individuals with this disorder and may be the first sign, appearing before other symptoms.The majority of individuals with GAMT deficiency have intellectual disabilities, seizure disorders, muscle weakness, behavior disorders, and movement disorders. People with GAMT may have weak muscle tone and delayed development of motor skills such as sitting or walking. Severely affected patients may lose previously acquired skills such as the ability to support their head or to sit unsupported. The prevalence of GAMT deficiency has been estimated to be from 1 out of 2,640,000 to 1 out of 550,000 patients being diagnosed to a conflicting report of 1 out of 115,000 patients being diagnosed.  As of 2015, there have only been 110 individuals with GAMT deficiency diagnosed worldwide. GAMT deficiency patients are frequently misdiagnosed with cerebral palsy as infants and toddlers. Children are often misdiagnosed with autism or global developmental delays.","autism, seizure disorders, movement disorders, behavior disorders, global developmental delays, cerebral palsy, intellectual disabilities",DISEASE
Keratoconus,"Keratoconus is an eye (ocular) disorder characterized by progressive thinning and changes in the shape of the cornea. The cornea is the thin, clear outer layer of the eye and is normally dome-shaped. Slowly progressive thinning of the cornea causes a cone-shaped bulge to develop towards the center of the cornea in the areas of greatest thinning. Affected individuals develop blurry or distorted vision, sensitivity to light (photophobia), and additional vision problems. Keratoconus often begins at puberty and most often is seen in teenagers or young adults. The specific underlying cause is not fully understood and most likely the condition results from the interaction of multiple factors including genetic and environmental ones. One factor known to contribute to progression of keratoconus is eye rubbing.  In some cases, keratoconus may occur as part of a larger disorder. Keratoconus is treated with glasses or contact lenses early in the condition. A small number of individuals may require surgery.","Keratoconus, eye (ocular) disorder, keratoconus",DISEASE
Opsoclonus,"The component features of OMS include repeated, random and rapid eye movements in both horizontal, vertical and diagonal directions (opsoclonus); unsteady gait or loss of ability to stand and walk (ataxia); brief, repeated, shock-like spasms of several muscles within the arms, legs (myoclonus), or tremor interfering with hand use. Behavioral and sleep disturbances, including extreme irritability, inconsolable crying, reduced and fragmented sleep (insomnia) and rage attacks are common. Difficulty articulating speech (dysarthria), sometimes with complete loss of speech and language may occur. Additional symptoms such as decreased muscle tone (hypotonia) and vomiting are common. The most common cause of OMS in young children is paraneoplastic. A small, often hidden tumor presumably provokes the immune system into attacking the nervous system, which may also control the tumor or even cause it to regress. Tumors are NOT in the brain, but are in other areas of the body, usually in chest or abdomen. In 50-80 percent of affected young children, a tumor of embryonic nerve cells (neuroblastoma or ganglioneuroblastoma) is responsible for the symptoms associated with OMS. In other affected individuals, the disorder has been designated ‘idiopathic’ or attributed to various mostly viral infections. However, the high rate of spontaneous tumor regression means that the tumor may be gone before it is looked for. In older children or teens, viral infections are the most frequent apparent cause of OMS. In adults, paraneoplastic etiology is more common, most due to lung or breast cancers. In contrast to paraneoplastic OMS in infants and young children, whose tumors are biologically inactive and often benign, the tumors in adults are commonly malignant, often disseminated. OMS is a rare disorder: 1 per million individuals worldwide. It usually affects infants and young children, although it is also known to affect adults. The peak age in children is about 18 months, with very few diagnosed before 1 year, and a long tail out to about 5 – 6 years. Occurrence of opsoclonus in infants under 6 months old is quite uncommon, and opsoclonus in that age group, when isolated, is usually from another cause. OMS occurs in only slightly more girls than boys. It occurs in about 3% of all children with neuroblastomas. The diagnosis is clinical; there is no diagnostic test yet, as the antigen remains unidentified. The presence of the ‘dancing eyes’, the shock-like muscle spasms, and the impairment of gait, especially if accompanied by irritability, are highly reliable indicators of this syndrome. To detect a tumor in children, either a CT scan with oral and IV contrast or MRI with gadolinium of the neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis need to be done. PET scanning is often done in adults with OMS looking for other occult tumors. In addition, a spinal tap to detect neuroinflammation is necessary. Besides routine tests for infection, recommended CSF studies include so-called “MS panel”, to include oligoclonal bands (with paired serum sample), looking for antibodies secreted by B cells in the CSF. Also, lymphocyte subset analysis (flow cytometry) using immunophenotyping reveals an increased frequency of CSF CD 19+ B cells, which is an invaluable biomarker of OMS disease activity. Autoantibodies in some children with OMS have been at detected in research laboratories, but commercial autoantibody testing is not cost-effective and best reserved for atypical cases.

Stickler-Syndrome,"Stickler syndrome affects males as well as females. Prevalence rates have been estimated at 1-3 per 10,000 births and at 1 per 7,500 births. Most investigators believe that the disorder is highly under-diagnosed, making it difficult to determine the true prevalence of Stickler syndrome in the general population. Stickler syndrome is one of the most common connective tissue disorders in the United States. A diagnosis of Stickler syndrome is made based upon a thorough clinical evaluation, a detailed patient history and identification of characteristic findings. As yet, no universally agreed upon criteria for the diagnosis of Stickler syndrome exists.

HTLV-Type-I-and-Type-II,"HTLV-I was first isolated in 1980 from a patient originally thought to have a cutaneous lymphoma. It became clear that it was a distinct form of lymphoma, which was designated as acute T-cell leukemia/ lymphoma (ATL). Some years later, different groups in Martinique and Japan described an association between a chronic disease of the spinal cord and HTLV-I infection, which was later named HTLV-I associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP). Since then, several other conditions have been linked to HTLV infection.",chronic disease of the spinal cord,DISEASE

According to some sources approximately 100 new cases of CIP are reported in children in the United States each year. However, CIP often goes unrecognized or misdiagnosed making it extremely difficult to determine the true frequency of CIP in the general population. Children are predominantly affected by primary, non-familial, sporadic CIP. Adults are generally affected by secondary CIP, most often due to systemic diseases such as scleroderma, diabetes, or paraneoplastic syndromes.","paraneoplastic syndromes, diabetes",DISEASE
Myopathy-Myofibrillar,"Myofibrillar myopathies are a group of rare genetic neuromuscular disorders that may be diagnosed in childhood but most often appear after 40 years of age. These conditions are highly variable but are characterized by a slowly progressive muscle weakness that can involve skeletal and smooth muscle. Skeletal muscle weakness can be present in the muscles close to the center of the body (proximal) as well as the distal muscles. A weakening of the heart muscle (cardiomyopathy) is common and may manifest as arrhythmia, conduction defects or congestive heart failure. The frequency of myofibrillar myopathies has not been estimated.  It is likely that these conditions are unrecognized and underdiagnosed. A diagnosis of myofibrillar myopathies is made based on clinical findings, electromyography, nerve conduction studies and muscle biopsy.

Molecular genetic testing for the BAG3 gene is available on a research basis only.","genetic neuromuscular disorders, congestive heart failure, cardiomyopathy",DISEASE
Cyclic-Vomiting-Syndrome,"Cyclic vomiting syndrome affects females somewhat more often than males (55:45). It most commonly occurs in children between the ages of three and seven, although it can begin at any age, from early infancy through to old age (73 is the oldest). Because it is not recognized or misdiagnoses as stomach flu, a correct diagnosis is often delayed for many years. Although CVS is found more often in children, it is being recognized with greater frequency in adults. The incidence of CVS is unknown, although it is not rare. Two studies in Scotland and Australia have suggested that as many as 2% of all Caucasian school-aged children suffer from CVS. However, researchers believe the disorder is underdiagnosed, making it difficult to estimate its true frequency in the general population. CVS was first described in the medical literature in 1806 in French, and 1882 in English. A diagnosis of cyclic vomiting syndrome may be suspected based upon a thorough clinical evaluation, a detailed patient history, and identification of characteristic findings. The diagnostic criteria are currently based upon the consensus criteria of the North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition and the Rome IV Committee. The determination of CVS can only be made after other causes of recurrent vomiting have been ruled out. There is no “test” to prove the presence of cyclic vomiting syndrome, although the presence of urine ketosis early in an episode may be helpful. A variety of tests of may be used to rule out other, more common, causes of recurrent nausea and vomiting, including an upper gastrointestinal radiograph.",stomach flu,DISEASE
Acquired-Aplastic-Anemia,"Acquired aplastic anemia affects males and females in about equal numbers. Most cases affect older children, teenagers or young adults. The incidence of aplastic anemia in Europe and Israel is two new cases among 1 million people per year. The incidence rate is two or three times greater in Asia. The exact incidence rates exist for the United States is unknown although some sources say that approximately 500-1,000 new cases of aplastic anemia are diagnosed each year. A diagnosis of acquired aplastic anemia may be suspected when an otherwise healthy individual has low levels of all three blood cell types (pancytopenia). A diagnosis may be confirmed by a thorough clinical evaluation, a detailed patient history, and a variety of specialized tests, including a bone marrow biopsy. During this procedure, a small specimen of bone marrow tissue is surgically removed, usually from the hip or pelvis, and studied under a microscope. In acquired aplastic anemia this sample will show a dramatic reduction or complete lack of cells. Additional tests may be necessary to rule out other disorders such as leukemia and to determine if there is an inherited or genetic cause.",pancytopenia,DISEASE
Polymorphous-Low,"Polymorphous low-grade adenocarcinoma (PLGA) is a rare tumor of the salivary glands that is limited, to a great extent, to the minor salivary glands and commonly, but not exclusively, localized in the palate of the mouth. The major salivary glands are the parotid glands (at the side of the face, below the ears), the sublingual glands (below the tongue), and the submandibular glands (below the lower jaw).  As the name suggests, each of the major salivary glands is of substantial size and visible to the naked eye. There are about 600 to 1,000 minor salivary glands that are microscopic in size. These minor salivary glands are found in the lining (mucosa) of the lips, tongue, and hard and soft palate, as well as inside the nose, cheeks, and sinuses. A lump or mass in the palate or near any of the salivary glands should be seen by a physician as soon as possible.  A lingering pain in the area of the salivary glands is a signal to see a physician.  A change in the size and/or shape of one of the salivary glands (asymmetry) may be a sufficient reason to see a doctor.  Unexplained bleeding in the mouth is also a symptom warranting attention, and any persistent numbness on any part of the face or a weakening of the muscles on one side of the face should be brought to the attention of a physician.  Early diagnosis and treatment are important. Why a normal cell becomes malignant is not yet fully understood. In most instances PLGA affects people in their middle age.  The median age at which patients are diagnosed is 57 years, with a range of from 22 to 71 years.  For reasons that are unknown, this disease affects slightly more women than men. The diagnosis of PLGA may be suspected on history and clinical examination, but can be confirmed only by biopsy of the affected tissue.",tumor of the salivary glands,DISEASE
Pityriasis-Rubra-Pilaris,"The specific underlying cause of PRP is unknown, although a combination of a genetic predisposition, environmental trigger, and other unknown causes is believed to play key roles.

Chromosome-18-Monosomy-18p,"Chromosome 18, Monosomy 18p is a rare chromosomal disorder in which all or part of the short arm (p) of chromosome 18 is deleted (monosomic). The disorder is typically characterized by short stature, variable degrees of mental retardation, speech delays, malformations of the skull and facial (craniofacial) region, and/or additional physical abnormalities. Associated craniofacial defects may vary greatly in range and severity from case to case. However, such features commonly include an unusually small head (microcephaly); a broad, flat nose; a ""carp-shaped"" mouth; large, protruding ears; widely spaced eyes (ocular hypertelorism); and/or other abnormalities. Rarely (i.e., in about 10 percent of cases), Monosomy 18p may be associated with holoprosencephaly, a condition in which the forebrain (prosencephalon) fails to divide properly during embryonic development. Holoprosencephaly may result in varying degrees of mental retardation, other neurologic findings, and/or extremely variable midline facial defects, such as the presence of a single, central front tooth (maxillary incisor); closely spaced eyes (hypotelorism); an abnormal groove in the upper lip (cleft lip); incomplete closure of the roof of the mouth (cleft palate); and/or, in severe cases, absence of the nose and/or cyclopia. Cyclopia is characterized by fusion of the eye cavities (orbits) into a single cavity containing one eye. Chromosome 18, Monosomy 18p appears to affect females more frequently than males by a ratio of approximately three to two.  Reports indicate that the mean parental age is older than average for the mothers and fathers of children with Monosomy 18p (i.e., age 32 years and 38 years, respectively).  Since Monosomy 18p was originally described in 1963, over 120 cases have been reported in the medical literature.","chromosomal disorder, mental retardation, microcephaly, cleft lip",DISEASE

Grover_s-Disease,"Grover's disease is a rare, transient skin disorder that consists of small, firm, raised red lesions, most often on the skin of the chest and back. Diagnosis of this disorder becomes apparent under microscopic examination when the loss of the ""cement"" that holds the skin cells together is observed. Over time, as the skin loses the ""cement"", the cells separate (lysis). Small blisters containing a watery liquid are present. These blisters tend to group and have a swollen red border around them. Grover's disease is mainly seen in males older than forty or fifty. Its cause is unknown but it is thought to be related to trauma to sun damaged skin. The exact cause of Grover’s disease is not known.  It may be related to fragility of old sun-damaged skin.  Some doctors feel that this skin disorder may be related to heat and sweating.  There have been multiple cases of this disorder associated with such things as hot tubs, hot water bottles, electric blankets, steam baths and prolonged confinement to a bed.  This theory has not been proven.  At least one case of this disorder has been associated with follicle mites which are parasites.

Filariasis,"Filariasis is an infectious tropical disease caused by any one of several thread-like parasitic round worms. The two species of worms most often associated with this disease are Wuchereria bancrofti and Brugia malayi. The larval form of the parasite transmits the disease to humans by the bite of a mosquito. In the early stages of the infection, the patient characteristically complains of fever, chills, headaches and skin lesions. Any one of several antiparasitic agents may be effective in eliminating the worm. However, if the disease is left untreated, obstruction of the lymph flow will cause particular areas of the body especially the legs and external genitals, to swell profoundly. Symptoms are primarily a response to adult worms that cause inflammation. Chronic inflammation may progress to hardening of the lymphatic vessels (fibrosis) and obstruction of the lymph flow. Filariasis is a rare infectious tropical disorder caused by the round worm parasites (nematode) Wuchereria bancrofti or Brugia malayi.  Symptoms result primarily from inflammatory reactions to the adult worms.  Some people may also develop hypersensitivity reactions to the small larval parasites (microfilariae). Filariasis is common disease in tropical regions of the world.  The organism W. bancrofti is present throughout Africa, Asia, China, and South America. B. malayi is found in southern and southeast Asia.  Filariasis is extremely rare in North America and occurs only when these organisms are imported from tropical regions.  The infection is transmitted by several different types of tropical mosquitos which transfer the larval stage of the organism (microfilariae) from one host to another. Lymphatic filariasis affects about 120 million people worldwide.  Short-term travelers to areas where it is endemic are at low risk for this infection.  People who visit endemic areas for extended periods of time, and especially those who are in areas or situations in which they are intensely exposed to infected mosquitoes, can become infected.  Most infections seen in the U.S. are in immigrants from endemic countries, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).","infectious tropical disease, infectious tropical disorder",DISEASE
Stiff-Person-Syndrome,"Stiff-person syndrome (SPS) is a rare acquired neurological disorder characterized by progressive muscle stiffness (rigidity) and repeated episodes of painful muscle spasms. Muscular rigidity often fluctuates (i.e., grows worse and then improves) and usually occurs along with the muscle spasms. Spasms may occur randomly or be triggered by a variety of different events including a sudden noise or light physical contact. In most cases, other neurological signs or symptoms do not occur. The severity and progression of SPS varies from one person to another. If left untreated, SPS can potentially progress to cause difficulty walking and significantly impact a person's ability to perform routine, daily tasks. Although the exact cause of SPS is unknown, it is believed to be an autoimmune disorder and sometimes occurs along with other autoimmune disorders. A diagnosis of SPS is made based upon identification of characteristic symptoms, a detailed patient history, and a thorough clinical evaluation. Additional tests can be used to support a diagnosis and to rule out other conditions. Such tests include screening tests to detect the presence of antibodies against GAD-65, antibodies against amphiphysin (which are associated with paraneoplastic SPS) and an electromyography (EMG), a test that records electrical activity in skeletal (voluntary) muscles at rest and during muscle contraction. An EMG can demonstrate continuous muscle motor unit firing in stiff muscles, which is characteristic of SPS. High doses of diazepam will suppress the characteristic EMG results.","acquired neurological disorder, autoimmune disorders, autoimmune disorder",DISEASE
Fructose-Intolerance-Hereditary,"There are three inherited disorders of fructose metabolism that are recognized and characterized. Essential fructosuria, is a mild disorder not requiring treatment, while Hereditary fructose intolerance (HFI) and Hereditary fructose-1,6-biphosphatase deficiency (HFBP) are treatable and controllable but must be taken seriously. Hereditary Fructose Intolerance may be diagnosed at birth or shortly thereafter when the infant is weaned. Like other autosomal disorders it is equally distributed among males and females.  Estimates of the incidence of the disorder range widely from 1:10,000 to 1:100,000 births. A diagnosis of HFI can be definitively confirmed by either of two tests: an enzyme assay, requiring a liver biopsy, to determine the level of aldolase activity or a fructose tolerance test in which the patient's response to intravenous fructose feeding is carefully monitored. It should be carefully noted, however, that each of these tests carries with it a substantial risk, especially to a newborn child. A non-invasive DNA test is increasingly being recommended instead.","autosomal disorders, inherited disorders of fructose metabolism",DISEASE

Anemia-Pernicious,"Pernicious anemia is a rare blood disorder characterized by the inability of the body to properly utilize vitamin B12, which is essential for the development of red blood cells. Most cases result from the lack of the gastric protein known as intrinsic factor, without which vitamin B12 cannot be absorbed. The diagnosis of pernicious anemia may be confirmed by a thorough clinical evaluation, including a detailed patient history and specialized laboratory tests. During a Schilling test, the intestines' ability to absorb vitamin B12 is measured. The vitamin is labeled with radioactive cobalt and is ingested by mouth. X-ray studies can then determine if the body is properly absorbing this vitamin.",blood disorder,DISEASE
Spastic-Paraplegia-47,"AP-4-associated hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP) is a group of slowly-progressing neurodegenerative disorders that generally present with global developmental delay, moderate to severe intellectual disability, impaired/absent speech, microcephaly, seizures, and progressive motor symptoms. The conditions included in this group are SPG47, SPG50, SPG51 and SPG52 and all have similar symptoms. These conditions are inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern and are caused by mutations in genes that result in production of an abnormal adaptor protein complex 4. Since many of the initial clinical manifestations of SPG47 are nonspecific and may resemble other disorders characterized by spasticity, developmental delay / intellectual disability, and seizures, the diagnosis is often only made after further diagnostic testing. This may include a brain MRI showing characteristic features such as a thin corpus callosum, wide lateral ventricles and changes in the white matter. A definitive diagnosis is reached by genetic testing.","slowly-progressing neurodegenerative disorders, intellectual disability, microcephaly",DISEASE
Ahumada,"Ahumada-Del Castillo is a rare endocrine disorder affecting adult females, which is characterized by impairment in the function of the pituitary and hypothalamus glands. Symptoms may include the production of breast milk (lactation) not associated with nursing and the absence of menstrual periods (amenorrhea) due to the lack of monthly ovulation (anovulation). The symptoms of Ahumada-Del Castillo syndrome include the abnormal production of breast milk (galactorrhea) without childbirth and nursing, and the lack of regular menstrual periods (amenorrhea).  Women with this disorder have breasts and nipples of normal size and appearance.  Secondary female sexual characteristics, such as hair distribution and voice, are also normal.  Since the ovaries do not produce eggs, affected females cannot become pregnant. The exact cause of Ahumada-Del Castillo syndrome is not known, although some research suggests that small tumors in the pituitary or hypothalamus glands may be responsible for some cases.  These tumors are frequently microscopic and extremely difficult to detect.  Rarer causes of Ahumada-Del Castillo syndrome may be associated with low levels of thyroid hormone (hypothyroidism), chronic use of drugs that inhibit dopamine (antagonistics) (e.g., chlorpromazine or thorazine), and discontinuation of oral contraceptives (birth control pills).  In all cases, an over-secretion of the milk-producing hormone prolactin (hyperprolactinemia) results in the symptoms of Ahumada-Del Castillo. Ahumada-Del Castillo affects only females. The symptoms usually begin during adulthood.","amenorrhea, anovulation, hypothyroidism, hyperprolactinemia, galactorrhea, endocrine disorder",DISEASE
Central-Core-Disease,"Central core disease (CCD) is a rare genetic neuromuscular disorder that is classified as a congenital myopathy, meaning that it is a muscle disorder (myopathy) that is present at birth (congenital). Affected infants have diminished muscle tone (hypotonia) resulting in abnormal ""floppiness"", muscle weakness, and a variety of skeletal abnormalities such as side-to-side curvature of the spine (scoliosis). Muscle weakness normally affects the proximal muscles, which are those muscles closest to the center of the body such as the muscles of the shoulder, pelvis and upper arms and legs. Affected infants may experience delays in acquiring motor milestones such as crawling or walking. Some individuals with CCD may be susceptible to developing malignant hyperthermia, a condition in which individuals develop adverse reactions to certain anesthetic drugs. CCD may be very mild or may cause serious complications. Most cases are inherited as autosomal dominant trait and associated with nonprogressive muscle disease and a favorable prognosis. Some cases are inherited as autosomal recessive traits and are more likely to be associated with severe complications.","myopathy, malignant hyperthermia, nonprogressive muscle disease, genetic neuromuscular disorder, scoliosis",DISEASE
Primary-Biliary-Cholangitis,"Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) is a chronic, or long lasting, progressive liver disorder that mostly affects women and usually appears during middle age. PBC leads to inflammation and scarring of the small bile ducts (the plumbing system of the liver which transports bile, the substance that helps digest fat). When PBC is very severe, it can lead to yellow discoloration of the skin (jaundice). If PBC is untreated, it can lead to cirrhosis, or scarring of the entire liver, which can lead to liver failure.   PBC is divided into four stages, with stage 1 being early disease, where this is no significant scarring, to stage 4, or which is defined by cirrhosis. Although the exact cause of PBC is unknown, it is thought that it is likely due to a combination of factors such as  autoimmune (when a person’s own immune system attacks their body), genetic, and environmental factors. PBC affects mostly women, but more men are now being diagnosed. The disorder usually becomes apparent during middle age, initially affecting most individuals between the ages of 45 to 65 years. However, the disorder has been diagnosed in females as young as 22 years of age and in females in their early 90s. It has been estimated that PBC is one of the most common autoimmune diseases, affecting nearly 1 in 1000 women over the age of 40.","cirrhosis, chronic, or long lasting, progressive liver disorder",DISEASE
Immune-Thrombocytopenia,"Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is an autoimmune bleeding disorder characterized by abnormally low levels of blood cells called platelets, a situation which is referred to as thrombocytopenia. Platelets are specialized blood cells that help maintain the integrity of the walls of our blood vessels and help prevent and stop bleeding by accelerating clotting. A normal platelet count ranges from approximately 150,000 to 400,000 per microliter of blood depending on the laboratory. If someone has a platelet count lower than 100,000 per microliter of blood with no other reason for low platelets, that person might have ITP. There is currently no definitive laboratory test to diagnose ITP. Rather ITP is considered a diagnosis of exclusion (see below) meaning that other causes have been eliminated or are unlikely.

Hereditary-Hyperphosphatasia,"Hereditary hyperphosphatasia is a rare genetic bone disorder (osteopathy) that usually becomes apparent during infancy or early childhood. Affected individuals develop progressive skeletal malformations especially in the long bones of the arms and legs. Skeletal malformations in the legs may cause problems walking and may eventually result in short stature. Additional symptoms include pain, fractures of affected bones, and muscle weakness. Because the biochemical and radiographic findings of hereditary hyperphosphatasia are similar to those of Paget's disease (a focal skeletal disorder of adults characterized by abnormal bone turnover), the disorder is sometimes referred to as juvenile Paget's disease. However, despite these similarities, the two disorders are distinct. Hereditary hyperphosphatasia is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. Hereditary hyperphosphatasia affects males and females in equal numbers. Like all recessive disorders it is more common in countries where within-family marriage is practiced. More than 50 cases have been described since the disorder was first reported in the medical literature in 1956. A diagnosis of hereditary hyperphosphatasia is made based upon a thorough clinical evaluation, identification of characteristic symptoms and a variety of x-rays tests that reveal distinct radiographic findings.

This disorder is characterized by abnormalities in the peripheral and central nervous systems including low muscle tone (hypotonia), muscle weakness, decreased reflexes, impaired muscle coordination (ataxia), seizures and intellectual disability. Pale, tightly curled hair is frequently seen in those affected. Giant axonal neuropathy follows autosomal recessive genetic inheritance. Symptoms of giant axonal neuropathy occur in early childhood before the age of seven years. Both the central and peripheral nervous systems are affected. The central nervous system includes the brain and spinal cord and the peripheral nervous system spreads out from the brain and spinal cord to all other areas of the body. Characteristics include low muscle tone (hypotonia), muscle weakness, decreased reflexes, impaired muscle coordination (ataxia), seizures and intellectual disability. In contrast to purely peripheral neuropathies, the reflex of the toes known as Babinski’s sign is often positive, indicating involvement of central motor pathways. Most affected children have pale, tightly curled hair unlike their parent’s hair. Cranial nerves may also be affected leading to facial weakness, abnormal eyes and poor vision. An unusual leg posture is present in some affected children. Skeletal abnormalities such as scoliosis and foot deformities have been described and are thought to be a result of the nervous system dysfunction. Mental development is in most cases initially normal, but later in childhood degenerative mental changes (dementia) may occur as the disorder progresses. Giant axonal neuropathy is rapidly progressive, usually leading to dependence on a wheel chair by the second decade of life and death in the second or third decade. Giant axonal neuropathy is a rare disorder that presents in early childhood. This disorder affects equal numbers of males and females. The prevalence of giant axonal neuropathy and the frequency of carriers of one defective copy of the GAN gene is not known, but it is known that giant axonal neuropathy is a very rare disease. Diagnosis of giant axonal neuropathy is made by clinical findings and specialized tests including nerve conduction velocity, brain MRI and peripheral nerve biopsy. The hallmark finding on a peripheral nerve biopsy is the appearance of ""giant axons"" which are caused by the accumulation of neurofilaments. Molecular genetic testing for abnormalities in the GAN gene is available to confirm the diagnosis. Negative mutation screening of the region of the GAN gene which encodes the protein does not exclude the diagnosis of giant axonal neuropathy.","neuropathy, intellectual disability, peripheral neuropathies, dementia, scoliosis",DISEASE
Tongue-Hairy,"Hairy tongue is an uncommon, benign condition that is also known as black hairy tongue or lingua nigra. It is characterized by abnormal elongation and blackish or dark brownish discoloration or ""staining"" of the thread-like elevations (filiform papillae) that cover most of the tongue's surface (dorsum linguae). Such changes often begin at the back (posterior) region of the top of the tongue and extend toward the front (anterior) of the tongue's surface but never involve the undersurface. Hairy tongue is thought to result from failure of the normal “shedding” (desquamation) of the outermost layer of the filiform papillae, overgrowth of certain pigment-producing bacteria or fungi normally present in the mouth, and an abnormal accumulation of pigment residues, keratin, or other debris in the region.  (Keratin is a fibrous protein that is a primary component of the outermost layer of the skin, nails, and hair.)  Although the specific underlying cause of hairy tongue remains unknown, several potential predisposing factors have been implicated.  Such factors include treatment with certain antibiotic medications (e.g., tetracycline therapy, which may lead to overgrowth of certain fungi); the use of particular oral bismuth-containing medications; the use of mouthwashes; smoking; chewing tobacco; excessive alcohol consumption; and/or poor oral hygiene.  Hairy tongue is not infectious nor does it lead to oral cancer. In males or females with hairy tongue, the age of onset is variable.  Hairy tongue most commonly affects adults; however, it may sometimes occur during childhood or adolescence.  It is not an inherited disease. There are additional disorders and conditions that may result in abnormal color changes or other alterations of the tongue.  Such conditions and disorders are typically characterized by symptoms and physical findings that differ from those associated with hairy tongue.  (For further information, choose the specific condition name in question as your search term in the Rare Disease Database.) In individuals with suspected hairy tongue, receiving a thorough evaluation by physicians, dentists, and/or oral surgeons is important to exclude other underlying conditions and to confirm a diagnosis of hairy tongue. Recommended treatment measures typically include removing potential predisposing factors, such as stopping smoking, discontinuing antibiotic therapy if possible and receiving proper alternative treatments as necessary under a physician's direction, and/or other appropriate steps. In addition, affected individuals should speak with their dental specialists for guidance concerning appropriate measures to improve oral hygiene in their particular case. Such measures typically include using a soft-bristled toothbrush to regularly cleanse the tongue.",inherited disease,DISEASE
Paroxysmal-Cold-Hemoglobinuria,"Autoimmune hemolytic anemias as a group are estimated to affect 1-3 people per 100,000 in the general population.  Both the syphilitic and non-syphilitic forms of chronic PCH are exceedingly rare.  The prevalence and incidence rates are unknown.   Anyone may acquire PCH, but it is more common among children than among adults. An individual with a viral infection is at higher risk of contracting the disorder. No known genetic, sex, or racial risk factors exist, although the disease has been reported in families. A diagnosis of PCH may be suspected in some individuals with anemia. In particular, the diagnosis should be suspected in any acutely ill child with hemoglobinuria. A diagnosis is made based upon a thorough clinical evaluation, a detailed patient history, identification of characteristic symptoms and a variety of specialized tests such as a direct antiglobulin test (Coombs) test, which is used to detect certain antibodies that act against red blood cells. A diagnosis of PCH is confirmed by the results of a Donath-Landsteiner test, which can distinguish PCH from other forms of hemolytic anemia. The test consists of incubating a sample of the patient’s serum with normal red blood cells (RBCs) in the cold for 30 minutes and then warming the mixture to body temperature (37C). Hemolysis of the RBCs in this ""bi-phasic"" test indicates a diagnosis of PCH.","anemia, hemolytic anemia, hemoglobinuria, viral infection",DISEASE
Locked-In-Syndrome,"Locked-in syndrome is a rare neurological disorder that affects males and females in equal numbers. Locked-in syndrome can affect individuals of all ages including children, but most often is seen in adults who are more at risk for brain stroke and bleeding. Because cases of locked-in syndrome may go unrecognized or misdiagnosed, it is difficult to determine the actual number of individuals who have had the disorder in the general population.","stroke, neurological disorder",DISEASE
Hypothalamic-Hamartoma,"Hypothalamic hamartomas (HH) are rare, tumor-like malformations that occur during fetal development and are present at birth. They are non-progressive lesions and do not expand, spread or metastasize to other locations. They grow in proportion to normal brain growth, and consequently their relative size to the rest of the brain is the same for the lifetime of the patient. There is tremendous diversity in the type and severity of symptoms from patient to patient. However, symptoms are apparent during childhood in the overwhelming majority of patients. Two clinical phenotypes of HH are recognized: 1) central precocious puberty and 2) epilepsy and related neurobehavioral symptoms. Hypothalamic hamartomas are relatively rare. Population-based research has shown that HH with epilepsy occurs in 1 of 200,000 children and adolescents. The prevalence of HH with only precocious puberty is unknown. At least for HH with epilepsy, males appear to have a slightly higher risk than females (approximately 1.3 to 1 ratio). HH occurs worldwide, without any obvious geographical concentration of cases. It is currently felt that all ethnic groups are at equal risk. There are no identified maternal risk factors or fetal exposures that increase the risk of HH. As malformations of the ventral (inferior) hypothalamus, hypothalamic hamartomas are rather distinct from other conditions. It is important to note that tumors that occur in the same region (such as craniopharyngiomas, astrocytomas, optic nerve gliomas, etc) usually do not cause gelastic seizures. These tumors can, however, be associated with endocrine dysfunction, which includes precocious puberty under rare circumstances.","epilepsy, endocrine dysfunction, precocious puberty",DISEASE
Conradi-Hunermann-Syndrome,"Conradi-Hünermann syndrome is a rare genetic disorder characterized by skeletal malformations, skin abnormalities, cataracts and short stature. The specific symptoms and severity of the disorder may vary greatly from one individual to another. Conradi-Hünermann syndrome is classified as a form of chondrodysplasia punctata, a group of disorders characterized by the formation of small, hardened spots of calcium on the ""growing portion"" or heads of the long bones (stippled epiphyses) or inside other areas of cartilage in the body. Conradi-Hünermann syndrome is commonly associated with disproportionate and assymetric shortening of long bones, particularly those of the upper arms (humeri) and the thigh bones (femora), curvature of the spine and mild to moderate growth deficiency, resulting in short stature. Many affected individuals also have a prominent forehead; unusually flattened midfacial regions (midfacial hypoplasia), with a low nasal bridge; loss of transparency of the lenses of the eyes (cataracts); sparse, coarse scalp hair; and/or abnormal thickening, dryness, and scaling of the skin. Conradi-Hünermann syndrome is inherited as an X-linked dominant trait that occurs almost exclusively in females.",genetic disorder,DISEASE
Erythema-Multiforme,"Erythema multiforme (EM) is the name applied to a group of hypersensitivity disorders, affecting mostly children and young adults, and characterized by symmetric red, patchy lesions, primarily on the arms and legs. The cause is unknown, but EM frequently occurs in association with herpes simplex virus, suggesting an immunologic process initiated by the virus. In half of the cases, the triggering agents appear to be medications, including anticonvulsants, sulfonamides, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and other antibiotics. In addition, some cases appear to be associated with infectious organisms such as Mycoplasma pneumoniae and many viral agents. Erythema multiforme is a rare disorder that affects slightly more males than females.  It may begin at any age, but is most common in children and young adults. Usually, the diagnosis can be made on the basis of the size, shape, color and distribution of the target lesions.","herpes simplex, hypersensitivity",DISEASE
Norrie-Disease,"Norrie disease is a rare X-linked disorder that occurs due to errors or disruption (mutations) of the NDP gene. Norrie disease is a rare disorder that is fully expressed in males only. In rare cases, carrier females may display some symptoms of the disorder. The incidence and prevalence rates for Norrie disease are unknown. The disorder has been reported in all ethnic groups. A diagnosis of Norrie disease is suspected based upon a detailed patient history, a thorough clinical evaluation, and identification of characteristic findings. There may be a family history supporting X-linked inheritance. A diagnosis may be confirmed by molecular genetic testing in which a mutation in the defective gene (NDP) is identified. Such testing is available through clinical testing labs (www.genetests.org).",X-linked disorder,DISEASE
Phosphoglycerate-Kinase-Deficiency,"Phosphoglycerate kinase deficiency is a very rare disorder that is fully expressed in males only. However, females who carry a single copy of the disease gene (heterozygous carriers) may exhibit some symptoms associated with the disorder (i.e., hemolytic anemia). The disorder can be diagnosed at birth when enzymatic testing is done. More than 30 cases of PGK deficiency have been written up in the medical literature. It is thought that there are people with the disease who do not receive a diagnosis. The diagnosis is made on the basis of a thorough physical examination and confirmed by the results of laboratory tests.",hemolytic anemia,DISEASE
MELAS-Syndrome,"MELAS (Mitochondrial Encephalopathy, Lactic Acidosis, and Stroke-like episodes) syndrome is a rare disorder that begins in childhood, usually between two and fifteen years of age, and mostly affects the nervous system and muscles. The most common early symptoms are seizures, recurrent headaches, loss of appetite and recurrent vomiting. Stroke-like episodes with temporary muscle weakness on one side of the body (hemiparesis) may also occur and this can lead to altered consciousness, vision and hearing loss, loss of motor skills and intellectual disability. MELAS is caused by mutations in mitochondrial DNA and in one patient, this syndrome has been associated with mutations in a nuclear gene, POLG1. MELAS syndrome is a rare disorder that affects males and females in equal numbers. Although rare, MELAS syndrome is probably the most common type of mitochondrial myopathy caused by mutations in mtDNA. Some researchers believe that mitochondrial myopathies may go unrecognized and underdiagnosed in the general population, making it difficult to determine the true frequency of disorders like MELAS syndrome.","Stroke, intellectual disability",DISEASE
Mulibrey-Nanism,"Mulibrey nanism is an extremely rare autosomal recessive genetic disorder characterized by profound growth delays and distinctive abnormalities of the muscles, liver, brain, and eyes. The acronym MULIBREY stands for (MU)scle, (LI)ver, (BR)ain, and (EY)e.  Nanism is another word for dwarfism. A characteristic feature not included in the original acronym is the overgrowth of the fibrous sac that surrounds the heart restricting normal filling of the heart (constrictive pericarditis). Characteristic symptoms may include low birth weight, short stature, and severe progressive growth delays. Muscles are usually underdeveloped and lack normal tone (hypotonia). Some infants with this disorder may have an abnormally large liver (hepatomegaly). Infants typically have yellow discoloration in their eyes. Mulibrey nanism is an extremely rare disorder that affects males and females in equal numbers.   Approximately 110 patients have been reported worldwide with this condition.  Most of the reported cases are from Finland but this condition has also occurred in North America, South America, Central America, Spain, France and Egypt.","autosomal recessive genetic disorder, Nanism, dwarfism, constrictive pericarditis",DISEASE
Stomach-Cancer,"Stomach cancer is a general term for cancer affecting the stomach. Generally, it refers to cancer that arises from the cells lining the stomach. These cells, like all cancerous cells, exhibit abnormal and rapid growth. Early in the course of the disease there are usually no symptoms (asymptomatic). As the disease progresses, symptoms like indigestion, nausea, vomiting, and feeling full earlier than normal (early satiety) may develop. The cause of stomach cancer is multifactorial, which means that multiple factors that occur together are necessary for the cancer to develop. These factors can include genetic, immunologic, infectious, and environmental factors. Stomach cancer usually develops randomly for unknown reasons (sporadically), and there is usually no family history. There are about 28,000 people diagnosed with stomach cancer in the United States each year. It affects men more often than it does women, and about 75% of people are over the age of 50. Most people are diagnosed between 60-80 years of age. By some estimates, stomach cancer is the second most common cancer worldwide. Stomach cancer can affect people of all races and ethnic groups but occurs with greater frequency in individuals of African or Hispanic heritage and Native Americans. Worldwide, stomach cancer is more common in East Asia, Eastern Europe, and South America.","Stomach cancer, stomach cancer, cancer",DISEASE
Turcot-Syndrome,"Turcot syndrome is a rare inherited disorder characterized by the association of benign growths (adenomatous polyps) in the mucous lining of the gastrointestinal tract with tumors of the central nervous system. Symptoms associated with polyp formation may include diarrhea, bleeding from the end portion of the large intestine (rectum), fatigue, abdominal pain, and weight loss. Affected individuals may also experience neurological symptoms, depending upon the type, size and location of the associated brain tumor. Some researchers believe that Turcot syndrome is a variant of familial adenomatous polyposis. Others believe that it is a separate disorder. The exact cause of Turcot syndrome is not known. Turcot syndrome affects males and females in equal numbers. Approximately 150 cases have been reported in the medical literature.","inherited disorder, diarrhea",DISEASE
Paget_s-Disease,"Paget’s disease is rarely diagnosed in people under the age of 40 years but may occur in up to eight percent of the population over the age of 60 years. Paget’s disease affects individuals of all ethnic and racial groups. However, it affects individuals of Asian descent less frequently. Both men and women are affected with a slight male predominance. The prevalence of Paget’s disease in the United States is estimated to be 1-2 percent of the general population. The diagnosis of Paget’s disease may be confirmed by a thorough clinical evaluation, detailed patient history, and a variety of specialized tests, such as blood tests, x-rays, and urine tests. A blood test may reveal elevated levels of the enzyme alkaline phosphatase suggesting the diagnosis of Paget’s disease. A bone scan or x-ray may also be used to determine abnormalities in the bones. Urine tests, such as pyrilinks and osteomark, may also be used to assist in the diagnosis of Paget’s disease.",Paget’s disease,DISEASE
Carpenter-Syndrome,"Carpenter syndrome belongs to a group of rare genetic disorders known as “acrocephalopolysyndactyly” (ACPS) disorders. All forms of ACPS are characterized by premature closure of the fibrous joints (cranial sutures) between certain bones of the skull (craniosynostosis), causing the top of the head to appear pointed (acrocephaly); webbing or fusion (syndactyly) of certain fingers or toes (digits); and/or more than the normal number of digits (polydactyly). Carpenter syndrome is also known as ACPS type II. Carpenter syndrome appears to affect males and females in relatively equal numbers. More than 70 cases of the disorder have been recorded. In 10 patients that had sequence analysis for the disease causing gene, homozygosity (two copies) for the same nonsense mutation, (a change in the DNA that causes a change in the protein) was found. This is indicative of a founder effect in patients of northern European descent, which means that a high prevalence of a genetic disorder in an isolated or inbred population is due to the fact that many members of the population are derived from a common ancestor who had the disease causing mutation.","genetic disorder, syndactyly, polydactyly",DISEASE
Glanzmann-Thrombasthenia,"The symptoms of Glanzmann thrombasthenia usually begin at birth or shortly thereafter and include the tendency to bruise and bleed easily and sometimes profusely, especially after surgical procedures. Other symptoms may include susceptibility to easy bruising, nosebleeds (epistaxis), bleeding from the gums (gingival), intermittent gastrointestinal bleeding, and/or variably large red or purple colored spots on the skin that are caused by bleeding in the skin (purpura). Women with GT often also have unusually heavy menstrual bleeding, irregular uterine bleeding, and excess bleeding in childbirth. Rarely, internal bleeding and blood in the urine (hematuria) can occur. The severity of the symptoms varies greatly. Some affected individuals have mild bruising and others have severe hemorrhages that can be life threatening. Glanzmann thrombasthenia is a rare disorder that affects males and females in equal numbers. The symptoms of this disease are usually apparent at birth (neonates) or during infancy. Approximately 500 cases have been reported, but many cases have probably not been reported. This condition occurs with greater frequency in populations in which intermarriage within a group (consanguinity) is more prevalent such as in some regions of the Middle East, India, and France.",purpura,DISEASE
Autoimmune-Hepatitis,"Autoimmune hepatitis is a rare disorder that affects females 4 times as often as males. Type 1 is more common and is usually diagnosed in adults. Type 2 is more common in children and often involves a more severe disease process. There are also variant types of AIH; these include individuals with AIH and one of the other autoimmune liver diseases (primary sclerosing cholangitis or primary biliary cholangitis).Those with other autoimmune conditions have a 25-50% chance of developing another one and thus a higher risk for developing AIH. The new cases per year (incidence) are estimated at 1-2 per 100,000 and total cases (prevalence) are approximately 24 per 100,000. Studies suggest that the incidence of AIH is increasing and the reason is unknown.","autoimmune liver diseases, autoimmune conditions",DISEASE
Chromosome-5-Trisomy-5p,"Trisomy 5p is a rare chromosomal disorder in which all or a portion of the short arm (p) of chromosome 5 (5p) appears three times (trisomy) rather than twice in cells of the body. Often the duplicated portion of 5p (trisomy) is due to a complex rearrangement involving other chromosomes. These individuals have a variable phenotype depending on which chromosome is involved, the size of the duplication and whether there is loss of material from the same or another chromosome. In observed cases, trisomy 5p has appeared to affect females slightly more often than males and affects all ethnic groups. More than 40 cases have been described since the original description by Lejeune in 1964. While the features for trisomy 5p appear consistent, the diagnosis cannot be made on clinical features alone. Many of the features seen in trisomy 5p can be seen in other genetic conditions or chromosomal abnormalities.

Progressive-Symmetric-Erythrokeratodermia,"Progressive symmetric erythrokeratoderma (PSEK) represents a group of rare genetic skin disorders characterized by well-demarcated plaques of reddened, dry, and thickened skin. Typically, these lesions are distributed symmetrically on the body and tend to slowly expand and progress over time. The severity and progression of the disorder can vary greatly from one person to another, even among members of the same family. In some families, PSEK can be part of the clinical spectrum of other rare skin disorders, such as erythrokeratodermia variabilis or loricrin keratoderma. In the majority, the molecular cause of PSEKis not known. The symptoms of PSEK usually develop shortly after birth or during the first year of life. Infants develop reddened plaques of thickened, rough and/or scaly skin, especially on the face, buttocks, arms and legs. Over time, these lesions can cover large areas of the body. The distribution of these lesions is almost perfectly symmetrical, meaning the size, shape and location of the lesions are extremely similar on both sides of the body. These plaques are slowly progressive increasing in number and size throughout early childhood before either stabilizing or disappearing sometime later during life. Rarely, waxing and waning may occur. In some cases, the chest and abdomen may become involved. Abnormally thickened or calloused skin on the palms and soles (palmoplantar keratoderma) is not uncommon. PSEK affects males and females in equal numbers. The prevalence of the disorder in the general population is unknown. The disorder was first described by Darier in 1911. Since then, fewer than 100 cases have been described in the medical literature. A diagnosis of PSEK is made based upon identification of characteristic symptoms, a detailed patient history, a thorough clinical evaluation and specialized tests including genetic testing or surgical removal (biopsy) and microscopic evaluation of affected tissue.","skin disorders, genetic skin disorders",DISEASE
Meningitis-Bacterial,"Bacterial Meningitis is a central nervous system disease caused by certain types of bacteria. Meningitis is characterized by inflammation of the membranes (meninges) around the brain or spinal cord. Inflammation can begin suddenly (acute) or develop gradually (subacute). Major symptoms may include fever, headache, and a stiff neck, sometimes with aching muscles. Nausea, vomiting and other symptoms may occur. In the United States, approximately 2,600 sporadic cases of Bacterial Meningitis are reported each year.  Meningitis caused by pneumococcal infections affects about 1.1 in 100,000 individuals.  Meningitis caused by haemophilus influenza affects about .2 in 100,000 individuals.  About 70 percent of all Bacterial Meningitis occurs in children aged 5 and under.  Children under age 2 are at highest risk for infection, and males are affected more often than females.  Bacterial Meningitis in general occurs most often during the first month of a newborn’s life and is usually caused by gram-negative bacteria such as Escherichia coli or by group B streptococcus.  Bacterial Meningitis caused by Hemophilus influenzae type B occurs most often in infants over 1 month old and young children.  However, in the United States, this type of Bacterial Meningitis occurs more often in adults as a result of a vaccine that has led to a decline in the number of affected infants and children.   Bacterial Meningitis caused by pneumococcus bacteria occurs most often in adults, but there are an estimated 1,400 cases of pneumococcal meningitis each year among children under age five. Testing for Bacterial Meningitis may include imaging techniques such as CT scans or MR imaging. Other testing may include examination of the patient's blood and/or skin.

Kniest-Dysplasia,"Kniest dysplasia is one of several forms of dwarfism that is caused by a change (mutation) in a gene known as COL2A1. This gene is involved in the production of a particular protein that forms type 2 collagen, which is essential for the normal development of bones and other connective tissue. Changes in the composition of type 2 collagen lead to abnormal skeletal growth and, thus, to a variety of dwarfing conditions known as skeletal dysplasias. Kniest Syndrome is a rare disorder that affects males and females in equal numbers. Newborns with this disorder are clearly in distress so that x-rays may be ordered. Diagnosis may frequently be made on the basis of the radiographs developed, while a bone biopsy usually clarifies more ambiguous cases.","dwarfing conditions, skeletal dysplasias",DISEASE
Kluver,"Major symptoms may include excessive oral tendencies with an urge to put all kinds of objects into the mouth, hypermetamorophosis (a need to explore everything), memory loss, emotional changes, extreme sexual behavior, indifference, placidity, visual distractibility and visual agnosia (difficulty identifying and processing visual information). An almost uncontrollable appetite for food may also be noted. There may also be other symptoms associated with dementia (loss of reason) as well. Klüver-Bucy syndrome is the result of damage to the temporal lobes of the brain. This may be the result of trauma to the brain itself, or the result of other degenerative brain diseases, tumors, or it can be caused by some brain infections, most commonly herpes simplex encephalitis (a viral brain infection).

Lennox,"Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) is a severe form of epilepsy that typically becomes apparent during infancy or early childhood. Affected children experience several different types of seizures most commonly atonic, tonic and atypical absence seizures. Children with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome may also develop cognitive dysfunction, delays in reaching developmental milestones and behavioral problems. Lennox-Gastaut syndrome can be caused by a variety of underlying conditions, but in some cases no cause can be identified. Lennox-Gastaut syndrome can be difficult to treat because it is resistant (refractory) to many kinds of antiseizure medications. Research is ongoing to identify and assess new therapies for Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Lennox-Gastaut syndrome affects males slightly more often than females. Lennox-Gastaut syndrome is estimated to occur in .1-.28 people per 100,000 and is believed to account for 1-4 percent of all cases of childhood epilepsy.

Keratosis-Seborrheic,"Seborrheic Keratosis is a skin disorder usually characterized by discolored lesions that appear to be ""stuck on"" the skin surface. Warts may appear and skin is often oily or greasy. These skin lesions are sometimes mistaken for cancerous growths and tend to appear predominately during middle age. Itching, irritation, inflammations or unsightliness of lesions may require surgical removal of affected skin areas. Symptoms of Seborrheic Keratosis are limited to discolored skin lesions that appear to be “stuck on” the skin surface.  These patches may appear suddenly, may vary in size, and tend to grow slowly.  They may be round or oval-shaped, and vary in color from tan, yellowish-brown to black.  They may be widespread over the trunk, back, and/or shoulders.  Some may be large enough to be called “giants” while others may be limited to small areas of the temples or cheeks.  The skin lesions may also be waxy, scaling or crusted.  They tend to become darker and larger with age. The exact cause of Seborrheic Keratosis is not known although researchers believe some forms may be inherited as a dominant trait.  Human traits including the classic genetic diseases, are the product of the interaction of two genes for that condition, one received from the father and one from the mother.  In dominant disorders, a single copy of the disease gene (received from either the mother or father) will be expressed “dominating” the normal gene and resulting in appearance of the disease.  The risk of transmitting the disorder from affected parent to offspring is 50% for each pregnancy regardless of the sex of the resulting child.) Seborrheic Keratosis predominately affects middle aged individuals, although in very rare cases, it can be present at birth. Since Seborrheic Keratosis is not a form of skin cancer, treatment is not essential and removal of lesions is usually performed only to enhance comfort and/or cosmetic appearance. Treatment of Seborrheic Keratosis consists of removal of the skin lesions by scraping (curettage), sealing off blood vessels or destruction of lesions (electrodessication) with local anesthetic, shave excision, or freezing with CO2 snow or liquid nitrogen. Trichloroacetic acid may be used to eliminate lesions. Dermabrasion removal may also be performed. In most cases, scarring is not associated with removal of these skin lesions.","skin cancer, classic genetic diseases, skin disorder, dominant disorders, Seborrheic Keratosis",DISEASE

It is characterized by scrotum pain and redness with rapid progression to gangrene and sloughing of tissue. Fournier gangrene is usually secondary to perirectal or periurethral infections associated with local trauma, operative procedures, or urinary tract disease. The mean age of presentation is about 50 years, but the range of patient ages in reported cases is from eight days to 90 years. Fournier gangrene is diagnosed more frequently among males. It may be that the high male to female ratio in the diagnosis is the result of the lack of recognition of this entity among women by physicians. It is believed that the male to female proportion may be anywhere from 5:1 to 10:1.","urinary tract disease, perirectal infections, periurethral infections",DISEASE
Congenital-Fiber-Type-Disproportion,"Congenital fiber type disproportion (CFTD) is a rare genetic muscle disease that is usually apparent at birth (congenital myopathy). It belongs to a group of muscle conditions called the congenital myopathies that tend to affect people in a similar pattern. Major symptoms may include loss of muscle tone (hypotonia) and generalized muscle weakness. Delays in motor development are common and people with more marked muscle weakness also have abnormal side-to-side curvature of the spine (scoliosis), dislocated hips, and the permanent fixation of certain joints in a flexed position (contractures), particularly at the ankle. CFTD affects males and females in equal numbers. The incidence of the disorder in the general population is unknown but it is uncommon. The disorder is usually present at birth (congenital) but may not be recognized for many months.

Rabies,"Rabies is an infectious disease that can affect all species of warmblooded animals, including man. This disorder is transmitted by the saliva of an infected animal and is caused by a virus (Neurotropic lyssavirus) that affects the salivary glands and the central nervous system. The symptoms may lead to serious complications if the virus is not treated immediately. Rabies in humans has been almost completely eliminated in most developed countries.  The vaccinations of domesticated animals and elimination of stray dogs has helped control this problem.  In the 1980’s the U.S. Centers for Disease Control had one case per year reported.  In the United States rabies is found primarily among wild animals such as skunks, foxes, bats, and raccoons.  There were 49 cases of human rabies reported in the U.S. between 1960 and 1986.

Sutton-Disease-II,"Sutton disease II is characterized by the recurring eruption of painful inflamed ulcers in the mouth (stomatitis). There may be multiple ulcers of varying sizes. These ulcers in the mouth are commonly called canker sores. Sutton disease II is also known as recurrent aphthous stomatitis. The exact cause of this disease is not fully understood, although it may be due to an abnormal immune response to the bacteria that are normally in the mouth. The exact cause of Sutton disease II is not known.  Several studies suggest that it may occur because of an abnormal immune response to the bacteria that are normally present in the mouth.  Deficiencies of iron, vitamin B12, and folic acid seem to increase an individual’s susceptibility to this disease. Stress and local injury may also be involved.  There seems to be no relationship between Sutton disease II and menstruation, pregnancy, and/or menopause, nor is it caused by herpes virus, which is the main cause of common canker sores. Sutton disease II affects more adult females than males.  However, before puberty, males and females are equally affected.  This disease occurs most frequently in malnourished children or adults whose immune systems are suppressed (i.e., by chemotherapy) or compromised (i.e., acquired immune deficiency syndrome).","stomatitis, acquired immune deficiency syndrome",DISEASE
Bernard,"The symptoms of Bernard-Soulier syndrome, which are typically apparent at birth and continue throughout life, may include the tendency to bleed excessively from cuts and other injuries, nosebleeds (epistaxis), and/or an unusually heavy menstrual flow in women. Some babies and children with BSS have no symptoms and the disorder does not present until adult life. People with this disease also bruise easily and the bruises tend to linger. Bleeding from very small blood vessels under the skin (subcutaneous) may cause small or widespread areas of small red or purple colored spots (purpura or petechiae). Bernard-Soulier syndrome is a rare bleeding disorder that affects males and females in equal numbers. Recent estimates suggest that Bernard Soulier syndrome affects 1 in a million people. More than 200 cases have been reported worldwide. The diagnosis of Bernard-Soulier syndrome is made by a combination of blood testing to reveal whether platelets are at abnormally low levels (thrombocytopenia), microscopic examination to determine the presence of abnormally large platelets and irregularly shaped platelets, and a test called ‘flow cytometry, which is able to measure the level of expression of the missing protein ion the outside of platelets affected by Bernard-Soulier syndrome. In recent years, most families are offered molecular genetic testing to identify which gene carries the mutations.","thrombocytopenia, bleeding disorder, purpura",DISEASE
Liposarcoma,"The specific cause of liposarcoma is still unknown. Clinically, it can be first noticed particularly in the extremity in an area of recent trauma where the patient may find a mass, however the cause and effect are quite likely purely coincidental. Liposarcoma generally is attributed to a change in some of the genes that are normally present in fat cells.  A series of abnormalities in these genes (mutations or DNA alterations) can lead to malignant changes characterized by uncontrollable growth. Liposarcoma is a soft tissue sarcoma, affecting approximately 2000 individuals each year in the United States. It affects men more than women, and more specifically middle-aged men ranging from 50 – 65 years of age. Children are rarely diagnosed, but when liposarcoma does occur in children, it is usually during adolescence. There is no specific ethnicity in which liposarcoma is more common. Certain risk factors have been shown to predispose individuals to developing soft tissue sarcomas, such as liposarcoma, including: prior radiation, familial cancer syndromes, damage to the lymph system, and long term exposure to certain toxic chemicals such as vinyl chloride, a chemical used to make plastic. There are other diseases that can present very similarly to liposarcoma. Lipoma is a non-cancerous (benign) tumor that can look similar to liposarcoma but it is usually softer and feels like a mass directly below the skin rather than in deeper parts of the body. A lipoma cannot transform into a liposarcoma. Other soft tissue tumors, such as undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma, lipomatous hemangiopericytoma, non-lipogenic sarcoma and gastrointestinal stromal tumors, can also look similar to liposarcoma when initially evaluated under a microscope.","familial cancer syndromes, soft tissue tumor",DISEASE
Pyruvate-Dehydrogenase-Complex-Deficiency,"Common symptoms of PDCD may initially be poor feeding, lethargy and rapid breathing (tachypnea) in an infant. Neurologic symptoms are progressive and usually start in infancy but may even be apparent at birth. These symptoms can include motor delay, poor muscle tone, seizures, incoordination (ataxia), abnormal eye movements and poor visual tracking. Infants with the prenatal onset form may demonstrate brain malformations on neuroimaging. Individuals with the early childhood-onset form of PDCD may have normal neurologic development with intermittent periods of ataxia, often associated with upper respiratory infection or other minor stress. Varying degrees of neurologic deficits and mental retardation may occur in individuals with PDCD. Several hundred cases of PDCD have been reported. More males than females have severe disease and early death and progressive neurological symptoms are observed more often in females, although some females have severe symptoms. Biochemical abnormalities may vary from severe acidosis (due to abnormally high levels of lactic acid) appearing shortly after birth to a mildly elevated level which usually follows a meal high in carbohydrates. In some cases elevation of blood lactate levels is seen only during the acute episodes. Excretion of abnormally large amounts of the amino acid alanine (alaninuria) may occur only during acute episodes. Imaging studies such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) may reveal structural brain abnormalities associated with severe disease. A definitive diagnosis can be made by demonstrating abnormal PDC enzyme levels or function in leukocytes, fibroblasts or from a tissue biopsy.",mental retardation,DISEASE
Mayer,"Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser (MRKH) syndrome is a rare disorder that affects women. It is characterized by the failure of the uterus and the vagina to develop properly in women who have normal ovarian function and normal external genitalia. Women with this disorder develop normal secondary sexual characteristics during puberty (e.g., breast development and pubic hair), but do not have a menstrual cycle (primary amenorrhea). Often, the failure to begin the menstrual cycle is the initial clinical sign of MRKH syndrome. The range and severity of MRKH syndrome can vary greatly and the disorder is generally broken down into type I, which occurs as an isolated finding, and type II, which occurs with abnormalities of additional organ systems including mainly the kidneys and the skeleton. Because of the nature of the disorder, MRKH syndrome can cause significant psychological challenges and counseling is recommended. The exact cause of MRKH syndrome remains largely unknown, but there is now no doubt of a genetic origin. In this respect, an update on the most recent research publications shows the involvement of several chromosomal segments, some of them including genes likely to account for the disorder.",amenorrhea,DISEASE
Acquired-Neuromyotonia,"Acquired neuromyotonia is an autoimmune disease in which the immune system malfunctions so that it damages parts of one’s own body. Approximately 40% of affected individuals have antibodies to voltage-gated potassium channels (VGKC’s) that affect the points at which the signals from the nerve fiber meet the muscle cell (neuromuscular junction). Aquired neuromyotonia is a rare disorder affecting males and females but is slightly more common among men. Disease onset is usually between the ages of 15 and 60 years but has also been reported in childhood. The diagnosis of acquired neuromyotonia is based on the presence of continuous muscle contractions (myokymia), especially in the face and hands, rhythmic tics or twitches (fasciculations), and muscle cramps. The diagnosis is confirmed by studies of the electrical signs of muscle activity (electromyography).",autoimmune disease,DISEASE
Kohler-Disease,"Kohler disease is a rare bone disorder of the foot in children that may be the result of stress-related compression at a critical time during the period of growth. It is characterized by limping caused by pain and swelling in the foot. It most often occurs in children between the ages 3-7, and affects males five times more often than females. Usually, just one foot is affected so children typically walk on the side portion of the foot. A diagnosis of Kohler disease is suspected based on the presence of the signs of symptoms in the child. The clinical diagnosis of Kohler disease is reinforced by X-rays that show flattening, sclerosis, and fragmentation of the navicular bone, which can be compared to the unaffected side to make the diagnosis. However, these abnormalities of the navicular bone are bilateral in approximately 25% of patients and may be seen in children who do not have Kohler disease.",pain,SYMPTOM
Testicular-Cancer,"Testicular cancer is an uncommon form of cancer and accounts for only 1% of all cancers in men. However, it is the most common form of cancer in men between the ages of 15 and 35. Approximately 8,850 men are diagnosed with testicular cancer each year in the United States. A variety of conditions can cause signs and symptoms that are similar to those seen in testicular cancer. This can include testicular torsion, epididymitis, epididymoorchitis, hydrocele, varicocele, hematoma, spermatocele, and syphilitic gumma. Testicular torsion in when a testicle rotates and twists around the spermatic cord (a collection of vessels, nerves, and ducts that runs to and from the testicles). Epididymitis is inflammation of the long, narrow, tightly coiled tube (epididymis) found behind each testicle. The epididymis carries sperm from the testicle to the spermatic duct. Epididymoorchitis is inflammation of the epididymis and the testicles. Hydrocele occurs when fluid builds up in the sac that surrounds the testicle leading to swelling and heaviness or discomfort of the affected testicle. Varicocele is the abnormal enlargement of the veins within the scrotum that can cause a feeling of discomfort or pain and impair fertility. A hematoma is a collection or small mass made up of clotted blood. A spermatocele is a noncancerous (benign) cyst that forms close to a testicle. Syphilitic gumma is a small, growth that can form in some people with syphilis.","pain, discomfort of the affected testicle, feeling of discomfort",SYMPTOM
Mitochondrial-Neurogastrointestinal-Encephalopathy,"Mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal encephalomyopathy (MNGIE) is a rare multisystem disorder characterized by progressive degeneration of the muscles of the gastrointestinal tract causing gastrointestinal dysmotility, weakness of extra-ocular muscles causing drooping of the eyelids (ptosis) and restricted eye movements (ophthalmoparesis), degeneration of peripheral nerves causing altered sensation and weakness the distal arms and legs, and general wasting (cachexia). The specific symptoms associated with MNGIE vary from case to case and may include vomiting, nausea, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and numbness or sensations of pins and needles in the hands and feet. . Additional findings may occur in some cases. MNGIE is caused by changes (mutations) in the TYMP gene encoding thymidine phosphorylase (TP) and is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait.","numbness or sensations of pins and needles in the hands and feet, nausea, abdominal pain",SYMPTOM
Glycogen-Storage-Disease-Type-VII,"Glycogen storage diseases are a group of disorders in which stored glycogen cannot be metabolized into glucose to supply energy for the body. Glycogen storage disease type VII (GSD VII) is characterized by weakness, pain and stiffness during exercise.  GSD VII is caused by abnormalities in the muscle phosphofructokinase gene that results in a deficiency of the phosphofructokinase enzyme. This enzyme deficiency leads to a reduced amount of energy available to muscles during exercise.  GSD VII is inherited as an autosomal recessive genetic disorder. GSD type VII usually begins in childhood and is characterized by weakness, pain and stiffness during exercise, sometimes associated with nausea and vomiting and dark, burgundy-colored urine due to the presence of myoglobin (myoglobinuria).  Destruction of muscle tissue (rhabdomyolysis) can also occur.  A rare form of GSD type VII has been reported in infants that is associated with progressive loss of muscle tone (hypotonia), muscle weakness and death.  A late-onset form has been reported in adults who experience only muscle weakness. Glycogen storage disease type VII is a rare disorder that occurs more often in individuals of Japanese and Ashkenazi Jewish descent.  GSD type VII affects males and females in equal numbers. GSD type VII is diagnosed by a muscle biopsy for measurement of the phosphofructokinase enzyme level or measurement of the phosphofructokinase enzyme level in red blood cells. Molecular genetic testing for the phosphofructokinase gene mutations prevalent in the Ashkenazi Jewish population are available on a research basis.","weakness, pain, nausea",SYMPTOM
Osteosarcoma,"Osteosarcoma is a form of cancer. It is a type of tumor that affects the bones. Osteosarcoma can affect people at any age, but is most common during the teen-aged years, and is the most common bone cancer affecting children and adolescents under the age of 20. The long bones of the legs, usually near where they connect to the knees, and the upper long bone of the arms, near where this bone meets the shoulders are the most common sites for osteosarcoma formation. Symptoms will vary depending upon the exact location and extent of disease. Pain is the most common symptom of osteosarcoma and there is often a mass or bump that can be felt (palpable). Eighty percent of individuals present with localized disease, which means the cancer remains in the area it first developed. Osteosarcoma can spread (metastasize) to other areas of the body, most likely the lungs. The exact cause is unknown in most individuals, but osteosarcoma can be induced by radiation. Most individuals are treated with a combination of chemotherapy and surgery. Sometimes, radiation therapy may be used. There are estimated to be about 750-1,000 new individuals diagnosed with osteosarcoma each year in the United States. About 450 of those are children or adolescents under the age of 20. Osteosarcoma is a rare disorder, but it is the most common cause of bone cancer in children and adolescents. These tumors usually affect individuals in their second decade of life (10-19 years of age), most often between 13 and 16 years of age, which most likely coincides with adolescent growth spurts. There is a second increase in the number of people with osteosarcoma in people over the age of 60. Overall, osteosarcoma accounts for about 1% of all cancers diagnosed each year in the United States. Osteosarcoma affect slightly more males than females and is slightly more common in African-Americans and Hispanics/Latinos than in Caucasians.",Pain,SYMPTOM
Renal-Cell-Carcinoma,"Renal cell carcinoma is a form of kidney cancer. Some patients with renal cell carcinoma do not have symptoms (asymptomatic). When symptoms are present, they may include blood in the urine; urine that is brown or rusty-colored; abdominal pain; weight loss; enlargement of one testicle or varicose veins of the testis (varicocele) in a male patient; fever; a thin, malnourished appearance; vision abnormalities; and elevated blood pressure. The most common feature of the syndrome is the passing of blood in the urine (hematuria). Renal cell carcinoma is more common in males than in females (ratio of 2 or 3 to 1) and in persons with a history of smoking.  It is also more common in persons with other types of kidney disorders and tends to run in some families.  Renal cell carcinoma accounts for approximately 30,000 new cases of kidney malignancies per year in the United States. Imaging studies, typically computerized tomography (CT) and abdominal ultrasonography (USG), are used in the diagnosis of renal cell carcinoma. Blood and urine testing may also be helpful.","asymptomatic, abdominal pain",SYMPTOM
Acidemia-Isovaleric,"Isovaleric Acidemia is a hereditary metabolic disorder. It is characterized by a deficiency of the enzyme isovaleryl CoA dehydrogenase. The disorder occurs in both an acute and a chronic intermittent form. In the acute form of Isovaleric Acidemia, vomiting, refusal to eat, and listlessness usually occur. With treatment and low protein diet, the disorder becomes chronically intermittent, and a nearly normal life is possible. Isovaleric Acidemia is a genetic disorder inherited through autosomal  recessive genes.  Symptoms are the result of a deficiency of the enzyme  isovaleric co-enzyme A (CoA) dehydrogenase, which is needed for the breakdown  of the amino acid leucine.  Human traits, including the classic genetic diseases, are the product of the interaction of two genes for that condition, one received from the father and one from the mother.  In recessive disorders, the condition does not appear unless a person inherits the same defective gene for the same trait from each parent.  If an individual receives one normal gene and one gene for the disease, the person will be a carrier for the disease, but generally will not show symptoms of the disorder. The risk of  transmitting the disease to the children of a couple, both of whom are carriers for a recessive disorder, is 25 percent.  On average, fifty percent of their children will be carriers of the disease, while 25 percent will receive a normal copy of the gene from each parent for that trait.  The risks are the same for each pregnancy. Isovaleric Acidemia is a rare disorder affecting males and females in equal numbers, usually beginning during infancy.","listlessness, refusal to eat",SYMPTOM
Hyperostosis-Frontalis-Interna,"Hyperostosis Frontalis Interna is characterized by the thickening of the frontal bone of the skull. It is not clear that this disorder is actually rare. Some clinicians believe that it may be a common abnormality found in as many as 12 percent of the female population. The disorder may be found associated with a variety of conditions such as seizures, headaches, obesity, diabetes insipidus, excessive hair growth and sex gland disturbances. Increased serum alkaline phosphatase and elevated serum calcium may occur. Hyperostosis Frontalis Interna affects females 9 times more often than males. This disorder presents itself most often among the middle-aged and elderly but has also been found in adolescents.",headaches,SYMPTOM
Degos-Disease,"Degos disease is an extremely rare disorder in which small and medium sized arteries become blocked (occlusive arteriopathy), restricting the flow of blood to affected areas. Degos disease usually causes characteristic skin lesions that may last for a period of time ranging from weeks to years. In some individuals, Degos disease will be limited to the skin (benign cutaneous Degos disease); other individuals will also develop symptoms affecting other organ systems (systemic Degos disease). Systemic Degos disease is most frequently characterized by lesions in the small intestine, but other organs are also affected. Major symptoms may include abdominal pain, diarrhea, and/or weight loss. The systemic form of Degos disease can cause life-threatening complications such as perforated bowels leading to inflammation of the abdominal cavity (peritonitis). The exact cause of Degos disease is unknown. A diagnosis of Degos disease is made based upon a thorough clinical evaluation, a detailed patient history, identification of characteristic findings (e.g., skin lesions), and microscopic examination of affected skin tissue that reveal distinctive changes to that tissue. Because most tests are normal, no specific laboratory test can be used to aid in the diagnosis of Degos disease.",abdominal pain,SYMPTOM
Erythromelalgia,"Erythromelalgia is a rare condition that primarily affects the feet and, less commonly, the hands (extremities). It is characterized by intense, burning pain of affected extremities, severe redness (erythema), and increased skin temperature that may be episodic or almost continuous in nature. (The prefix ""erythro-"" denotes redness, ""mel-"" is a combining form meaning limb or limbs, and the suffix ""-algia"" indicates pain.) Although erythromelalgia typically affects both sides of the body (bilateral), it may sometimes involve only one side (unilateral). The disease course may be extremely variable from case to case.","pain, intense, burning pain",SYMPTOM
Restless-Legs-Syndrome,"Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a neurologic and sleep related movement disorder characterized by an irresistible urge to move in the legs that typically occurs or worsens at rest. It is usually accompanied by abnormal, uncomfortable sensations, known as paresthesias or dysesthesias, that are often likened to crawling, cramping, aching, burning, itching, or prickling deep within the affected areas. Although the legs are usually involved, an urge to move with paresthesias or dysesthesias may also sometimes affect the arms or other areas of the body. Those with RLS may vigorously move the affected area, engage in pacing, or perform other, often repetitive movements, such as stretching, bending, or rocking. Symptoms typically worsen in the evening or at night, often resulting in sleep disturbances. Some individuals with RLS may also develop symptoms during other extended periods of inactivity, such as while sitting in a movie theater or traveling in a car. RLS may occur as a primary condition or due to another underlying disorder, certain medications, or other factors (secondary or symptomatic RLS). In primary RLS, the disorder is often genetic in origin or occurs for unknown reasons (idiopathic). Secondary RLS may occur in association with certain conditions, such as iron deficiency, low levels of the oxygen-carrying component of red blood cells (anemia), kidney failure, or pregnancy. Restless legs syndrome appears to be about twice as common in women than men. Associated symptoms may become apparent at any age, and the disorder is usually chronic, often becoming more severe with increasing age. However, in some affected individuals, RLS symptoms may periodically subside and recur with varying levels of severity. According to some reports, although most individuals do not bring their symptoms to the attention of physicians until middle age, up to 40 percent may initially experience symptoms before age 20. The diagnosis of restless legs syndrome (RLS) is based upon a thorough clinical evaluation; a complete patient history, including current medications; family history; and specialized tests. In addition, a clinical assessment scale may be used to help evaluate severity of the disorder. Various laboratory studies may be conducted to help detect or rule out possible associated conditions, including tests to measure iron and ferritin levels in the blood to assess iron stores in the body. In addition, a neurological examination may be conducted if associated neurological abnormalities are suspected (e.g., peripheral neuropathy). In addition, some physicians may recommend specialized sleep studies to evaluate sleep disturbances and possible PLMS, but sleep studies are not needed to diagnose uncomplicated RLS.","irresistible urge to move in the legs, paresthesias, aching, urge to move with paresthesias or dysesthesias, dysesthesias",SYMPTOM
Froelich-Syndrome,"Froehlich syndrome, also known as adiposogenital dystrophy, is a constellation of endocrine abnormalities believed to result from damage to the hypothalamus, a part of the brain that links the nervous system to the endocrine system via the pituitary gland.  The hypothalamus regulates sleep cycles and body temperature and composition while stimulating the pituitary gland to release a variety of hormones that control growth, metabolism, and body development. Thus, numerous pituitary gland hormones could be indirectly disrupted by damage to the hypothalamus. Unlike similar diseases such as Prader-Willi syndrome, Froehlich syndrome is acquired, not inherited, and is associated with tumors of the hypothalamus area or their surgical treatment, causing increased appetite and depressed secretion of gonadotropin. This syndrome affects males more often than females. Froehlich syndrome is characterized by increased or excessive eating that leads to obesity, small testes, and a delay in the onset of puberty. It is also common for children with Froehlich syndrome to experience the delay in physical growth and the development of secondary sexual characteristics. In addition to delayed growth and puberty, children with this syndrome tend to be short in stature. As a result of tumor growth, some children with Froehlich syndrome may also develop intellectual difficulties, poor vision – due optic nerve damage-, somnolence, and diabetes insipidus –  known as Infundibulo-tuberal syndrome (Froehlich+somnolence+diabetes insipidus), lower than normal body temperature (hypothermia) and very delicate skin. Froehlich syndrome is a very rare condition that affects more males than females.",increased appetite,SYMPTOM
Hiccups-Chronic,"A hiccup is an involuntary spasmodic contraction of the muscle at the base of the lungs (diaphragm) followed by the rapid closure of the vocal cords. Usually, hiccups last for a few hours or, occasionally, a day or two. However, chronic hiccups are ones that continue for an extended period of time. Episodes that last for more than two days and less than a month are sometimes called persistent hiccups. On rare occasions, hiccups persist even longer than a month or recur frequently over an extended period of time. The longest recorded episode of these chronic hiccups lasted 60 years. Hiccups are unmistakable, and rarely taken for anything else.  They often start for no apparent reason, and usually go away on their own in a few minutes.  Of concern is the period of time required for an episode to run its course.   Hiccups that persist over a period of time may cause exhaustion and weight loss from lack of sleep and the interruption of normal eating patterns. Hiccups affect males more often than females.  Hiccups occur in practically every human being, but chronic hiccups are very rare. There are many disorders involving the autonomic nervous system which controls unconscious activities of the body such as breathing, sweating, heartbeat, hiccups, coughing, etc. The diagnosis of chronic hiccups may be obvious, but blood, imaging, and other laboratory studies may be used to determine the underlying cause.",exhaustion,SYMPTOM
Mal-de-Debarquement,"The true cause behind MDD is still unknown.  MDD likely results from the body’s balance system inadequately processing and adapting to multiple sensory inputs (visual, vestibular, proprioceptive and cognitive) from the environment once the stimulus (trigger) has ended.  It is as yet undetermined as to the cause of the balance system’s inability to appropriately compensate and adapt. How or why this happens remains a mystery. The majority of people affected are adult females, although there have been reports of males having the diagnosis. Patients with migraine may have any increased susceptibility through unknown mechanisms. The diagnosis of MDD still remains mostly clinical. As such, the history is very important. Persistent “dizziness” after an ocean cruise, a sailing trip, a prolonged airplane flight or a cross-country road trip is highly suggestive of MDD. Vestibular function tests in patients with MDD have been normal or nonspecific in their abnormality. These tests are important in excluding other etiologies for the patient’s symptoms.","dizziness after an ocean cruise, a sailing trip, a prolonged airplane flight or a cross-country road trip",SYMPTOM
Trisomy-X,"Trisomy X is a chromosomal disorder that affects only females. Reported estimates of frequency have varied with the most common estimate being one in 1,000 female births. Because many females with the disorder may have few or no symptoms, they may never be diagnosed. Researchers believe that the disorder is underdiagnosed and that the reported number of affected females as reflected in the medical literature is inappropriately low. Researchers believe that only approximately 10 percent of affected individuals are diagnosed. With increased detection, more in depth studies may be conducted and more girls with trisomy X can be appropriately treated.",females few or no symptoms,SYMPTOM
Cyclic-Vomiting-Syndrome,"Cyclic vomiting syndrome affects females somewhat more often than males (55:45). It most commonly occurs in children between the ages of three and seven, although it can begin at any age, from early infancy through to old age (73 is the oldest). Because it is not recognized or misdiagnoses as stomach flu, a correct diagnosis is often delayed for many years. Although CVS is found more often in children, it is being recognized with greater frequency in adults. The incidence of CVS is unknown, although it is not rare. Two studies in Scotland and Australia have suggested that as many as 2% of all Caucasian school-aged children suffer from CVS. However, researchers believe the disorder is underdiagnosed, making it difficult to estimate its true frequency in the general population. CVS was first described in the medical literature in 1806 in French, and 1882 in English. A diagnosis of cyclic vomiting syndrome may be suspected based upon a thorough clinical evaluation, a detailed patient history, and identification of characteristic findings. The diagnostic criteria are currently based upon the consensus criteria of the North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition and the Rome IV Committee. The determination of CVS can only be made after other causes of recurrent vomiting have been ruled out. There is no “test” to prove the presence of cyclic vomiting syndrome, although the presence of urine ketosis early in an episode may be helpful. A variety of tests of may be used to rule out other, more common, causes of recurrent nausea and vomiting, including an upper gastrointestinal radiograph.",recurrent nausea,SYMPTOM
Polymorphous-Low,"Polymorphous low-grade adenocarcinoma (PLGA) is a rare tumor of the salivary glands that is limited, to a great extent, to the minor salivary glands and commonly, but not exclusively, localized in the palate of the mouth. The major salivary glands are the parotid glands (at the side of the face, below the ears), the sublingual glands (below the tongue), and the submandibular glands (below the lower jaw).  As the name suggests, each of the major salivary glands is of substantial size and visible to the naked eye. There are about 600 to 1,000 minor salivary glands that are microscopic in size. These minor salivary glands are found in the lining (mucosa) of the lips, tongue, and hard and soft palate, as well as inside the nose, cheeks, and sinuses. A lump or mass in the palate or near any of the salivary glands should be seen by a physician as soon as possible.  A lingering pain in the area of the salivary glands is a signal to see a physician.  A change in the size and/or shape of one of the salivary glands (asymmetry) may be a sufficient reason to see a doctor.  Unexplained bleeding in the mouth is also a symptom warranting attention, and any persistent numbness on any part of the face or a weakening of the muscles on one side of the face should be brought to the attention of a physician.  Early diagnosis and treatment are important. Why a normal cell becomes malignant is not yet fully understood. In most instances PLGA affects people in their middle age.  The median age at which patients are diagnosed is 57 years, with a range of from 22 to 71 years.  For reasons that are unknown, this disease affects slightly more women than men. The diagnosis of PLGA may be suspected on history and clinical examination, but can be confirmed only by biopsy of the affected tissue.",lingering pain in the area of the salivary glands,SYMPTOM
Arachnoiditis,"There are numerous conditions characterized by signs and symptoms that are similar to those found in arachnoiditis, however, only a few will be listed. They include the failed back surgery syndrome, multiple sclerosis, fibromyalgia, reflex sympathetic dystrophy, chronic pain syndrome, cauda equina syndrome, syringomyelia, and some spinal cord tumors. In many cases, certain conditions can arise as complications of arachnoiditis, further rendering the diagnosis, more complex. Occasionally, the symptoms manifested by some individuals with arachnoiditis may be dismissed as psychosomatic and these patients may be branded as “pain is in your head” cases.",pain,SYMPTOM
Filariasis,"Filariasis is an infectious tropical disease caused by any one of several thread-like parasitic round worms. The two species of worms most often associated with this disease are Wuchereria bancrofti and Brugia malayi. The larval form of the parasite transmits the disease to humans by the bite of a mosquito. In the early stages of the infection, the patient characteristically complains of fever, chills, headaches and skin lesions. Any one of several antiparasitic agents may be effective in eliminating the worm. However, if the disease is left untreated, obstruction of the lymph flow will cause particular areas of the body especially the legs and external genitals, to swell profoundly. Symptoms are primarily a response to adult worms that cause inflammation. Chronic inflammation may progress to hardening of the lymphatic vessels (fibrosis) and obstruction of the lymph flow. Filariasis is a rare infectious tropical disorder caused by the round worm parasites (nematode) Wuchereria bancrofti or Brugia malayi.  Symptoms result primarily from inflammatory reactions to the adult worms.  Some people may also develop hypersensitivity reactions to the small larval parasites (microfilariae). Filariasis is common disease in tropical regions of the world.  The organism W. bancrofti is present throughout Africa, Asia, China, and South America. B. malayi is found in southern and southeast Asia.  Filariasis is extremely rare in North America and occurs only when these organisms are imported from tropical regions.  The infection is transmitted by several different types of tropical mosquitos which transfer the larval stage of the organism (microfilariae) from one host to another. Lymphatic filariasis affects about 120 million people worldwide.  Short-term travelers to areas where it is endemic are at low risk for this infection.  People who visit endemic areas for extended periods of time, and especially those who are in areas or situations in which they are intensely exposed to infected mosquitoes, can become infected.  Most infections seen in the U.S. are in immigrants from endemic countries, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).","headaches, chills",SYMPTOM
Renal-Glycosuria,"Renal glycosuria, also known as renal glucosuria, is a rare condition in which the simple sugar glucose is eliminated (excreted) in the urine despite normal or low blood glucose levels. With normal kidney (renal) function, glucose is excreted in the urine only when there are abnormally elevated levels of glucose in the blood. However, in those with renal glycosuria, glucose is abnormally eliminated in the urine due to improper functioning of the renal tubules, which are primary components of the filtering units of the kidneys (nephrons). In most affected individuals, the condition causes no apparent symptoms (asymptomatic) or serious effects. When renal glycosuria occurs as an isolated finding with otherwise normal kidney function, the condition is thought to be inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. Renal glycosuria is a rare condition that appears to affect males and females in equal numbers.  Reported cases of the disorder include affected individuals in several multigenerational families (kindreds).  In most individuals with renal glycosuria, no associated symptoms are apparent (asymptomatic).  Less commonly, under certain conditions, such as during pregnancy or starvation, serious symptoms and findings may become apparent (e.g., dehydration, ketosis). Renal glycosuria is diagnosed based upon laboratory tests that confirm the presence of glucose in the urine in association with normal or low blood glucose levels. (Such testing is typically conducted after overnight fasting.)",asymptomatic,SYMPTOM
Hereditary-Hyperphosphatasia,"Hereditary hyperphosphatasia is a rare genetic bone disorder (osteopathy) that usually becomes apparent during infancy or early childhood. Affected individuals develop progressive skeletal malformations especially in the long bones of the arms and legs. Skeletal malformations in the legs may cause problems walking and may eventually result in short stature. Additional symptoms include pain, fractures of affected bones, and muscle weakness. Because the biochemical and radiographic findings of hereditary hyperphosphatasia are similar to those of Paget's disease (a focal skeletal disorder of adults characterized by abnormal bone turnover), the disorder is sometimes referred to as juvenile Paget's disease. However, despite these similarities, the two disorders are distinct. Hereditary hyperphosphatasia is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. Hereditary hyperphosphatasia affects males and females in equal numbers. Like all recessive disorders it is more common in countries where within-family marriage is practiced. More than 50 cases have been described since the disorder was first reported in the medical literature in 1956. A diagnosis of hereditary hyperphosphatasia is made based upon a thorough clinical evaluation, identification of characteristic symptoms and a variety of x-rays tests that reveal distinct radiographic findings. Affected individuals also have elevated levels of serum alkaline phosphatase and other biochemical markers of bone turnover, detectable through blood and urine tests.",pain,SYMPTOM
MELAS-Syndrome,"MELAS (Mitochondrial Encephalopathy, Lactic Acidosis, and Stroke-like episodes) syndrome is a rare disorder that begins in childhood, usually between two and fifteen years of age, and mostly affects the nervous system and muscles. The most common early symptoms are seizures, recurrent headaches, loss of appetite and recurrent vomiting. Stroke-like episodes with temporary muscle weakness on one side of the body (hemiparesis) may also occur and this can lead to altered consciousness, vision and hearing loss, loss of motor skills and intellectual disability. MELAS is caused by mutations in mitochondrial DNA and in one patient, this syndrome has been associated with mutations in a nuclear gene, POLG1. MELAS syndrome is a rare disorder that affects males and females in equal numbers. Although rare, MELAS syndrome is probably the most common type of mitochondrial myopathy caused by mutations in mtDNA. Some researchers believe that mitochondrial myopathies may go unrecognized and underdiagnosed in the general population, making it difficult to determine the true frequency of disorders like MELAS syndrome.","recurrent headaches, loss of appetite",SYMPTOM
Stomach-Cancer,"Stomach cancer is a general term for cancer affecting the stomach. Generally, it refers to cancer that arises from the cells lining the stomach. These cells, like all cancerous cells, exhibit abnormal and rapid growth. Early in the course of the disease there are usually no symptoms (asymptomatic). As the disease progresses, symptoms like indigestion, nausea, vomiting, and feeling full earlier than normal (early satiety) may develop. The cause of stomach cancer is multifactorial, which means that multiple factors that occur together are necessary for the cancer to develop. These factors can include genetic, immunologic, infectious, and environmental factors. Stomach cancer usually develops randomly for unknown reasons (sporadically), and there is usually no family history. There are about 28,000 people diagnosed with stomach cancer in the United States each year. It affects men more often than it does women, and about 75% of people are over the age of 50. Most people are diagnosed between 60-80 years of age. By some estimates, stomach cancer is the second most common cancer worldwide. Stomach cancer can affect people of all races and ethnic groups but occurs with greater frequency in individuals of African or Hispanic heritage and Native Americans. Worldwide, stomach cancer is more common in East Asia, Eastern Europe, and South America.","early satiety, nausea, Early asymptomatic",SYMPTOM
Turcot-Syndrome,"Turcot syndrome is a rare inherited disorder characterized by the association of benign growths (adenomatous polyps) in the mucous lining of the gastrointestinal tract with tumors of the central nervous system. Symptoms associated with polyp formation may include diarrhea, bleeding from the end portion of the large intestine (rectum), fatigue, abdominal pain, and weight loss. Affected individuals may also experience neurological symptoms, depending upon the type, size and location of the associated brain tumor. Some researchers believe that Turcot syndrome is a variant of familial adenomatous polyposis. Others believe that it is a separate disorder. The exact cause of Turcot syndrome is not known. Turcot syndrome affects males and females in equal numbers. Approximately 150 cases have been reported in the medical literature.","fatigue, abdominal pain",SYMPTOM
Meningitis-Bacterial,"Bacterial Meningitis is a central nervous system disease caused by certain types of bacteria. Meningitis is characterized by inflammation of the membranes (meninges) around the brain or spinal cord. Inflammation can begin suddenly (acute) or develop gradually (subacute). Major symptoms may include fever, headache, and a stiff neck, sometimes with aching muscles. Nausea, vomiting and other symptoms may occur. In the United States, approximately 2,600 sporadic cases of Bacterial Meningitis are reported each year.  Meningitis caused by pneumococcal infections affects about 1.1 in 100,000 individuals.  Meningitis caused by haemophilus influenza affects about .2 in 100,000 individuals.  About 70 percent of all Bacterial Meningitis occurs in children aged 5 and under.  Children under age 2 are at highest risk for infection, and males are affected more often than females.  Bacterial Meningitis in general occurs most often during the first month of a newborn’s life and is usually caused by gram-negative bacteria such as Escherichia coli or by group B streptococcus.  Bacterial Meningitis caused by Hemophilus influenzae type B occurs most often in infants over 1 month old and young children.  However, in the United States, this type of Bacterial Meningitis occurs more often in adults as a result of a vaccine that has led to a decline in the number of affected infants and children.   Bacterial Meningitis caused by pneumococcus bacteria occurs most often in adults, but there are an estimated 1,400 cases of pneumococcal meningitis each year among children under age five. Testing for Bacterial Meningitis may include imaging techniques such as CT scans or MR imaging. Other testing may include examination of the patient's blood and/or skin. Diagnosis is made by examination of the cerebrospinal fluid.","Nausea, headache, aching muscles",SYMPTOM
Fournier-Gangrene,"Fournier gangrene is an acute necrotic infection of the scrotum; penis; or perineum. It is characterized by scrotum pain and redness with rapid progression to gangrene and sloughing of tissue. Fournier gangrene is usually secondary to perirectal or periurethral infections associated with local trauma, operative procedures, or urinary tract disease. The mean age of presentation is about 50 years, but the range of patient ages in reported cases is from eight days to 90 years. Fournier gangrene is diagnosed more frequently among males. It may be that the high male to female ratio in the diagnosis is the result of the lack of recognition of this entity among women by physicians. It is believed that the male to female proportion may be anywhere from 5:1 to 10:1.",scrotum pain,SYMPTOM
Pyruvate-Dehydrogenase-Complex-Deficiency,"Common symptoms of PDCD may initially be poor feeding, lethargy and rapid breathing (tachypnea) in an infant. Neurologic symptoms are progressive and usually start in infancy but may even be apparent at birth. These symptoms can include motor delay, poor muscle tone, seizures, incoordination (ataxia), abnormal eye movements and poor visual tracking. Infants with the prenatal onset form may demonstrate brain malformations on neuroimaging. Individuals with the early childhood-onset form of PDCD may have normal neurologic development with intermittent periods of ataxia, often associated with upper respiratory infection or other minor stress. Varying degrees of neurologic deficits and mental retardation may occur in individuals with PDCD. Several hundred cases of PDCD have been reported. More males than females have severe disease and early death and progressive neurological symptoms are observed more often in females, although some females have severe symptoms. Biochemical abnormalities may vary from severe acidosis (due to abnormally high levels of lactic acid) appearing shortly after birth to a mildly elevated level which usually follows a meal high in carbohydrates. In some cases elevation of blood lactate levels is seen only during the acute episodes. Excretion of abnormally large amounts of the amino acid alanine (alaninuria) may occur only during acute episodes. Imaging studies such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) may reveal structural brain abnormalities associated with severe disease. A definitive diagnosis can be made by demonstrating abnormal PDC enzyme levels or function in leukocytes, fibroblasts or from a tissue biopsy.","minor stress, lethargy in an infant, poor feeding in an infant",SYMPTOM
Refractory-Celiac-Disease,"Refractory celiac disease (RCD) is a complex autoimmune disorder much like the more common celiac disease but, unlike celiac disease, it is resistant or unresponsive to at least 12 months of treatment with a strict gluten-free diet. Gliadin, a component of the wheat storage protein gluten, together with similar proteins in barley and rye, are the villains that trigger the immune reaction in celiac disease. The diagnosis of RCD is made by exclusion, especially of any other disorder that can affect the huge number of thread-like projections that line the interior of the intestine (intestinal villi), such as intestinal lymphoma, Crohn's disease, small intestinal bacterial overgrowth or hypogammaglobulinemia. Refractory celiac disease is rare among adults and is almost never seen in children. Data regarding the true incidence and prevalence of RCD are unreliable, but some have estimated that there might be 20,000 patients in the USA. However, those estimations are based on incomplete data. In one recent study, 1.5% of patients diagnosed with celiac disease at a single US center developed RCD. Of those with RCD 85% had the less severe Type I RCD. Virtually all clinicians studying refractory celiac disease emphasize that the diagnosis is based on eliminating all other possible sources of the symptoms and intestinal injury. One article lists more than 10 conditions that must be considered and eliminated before a convincing diagnosis of refractory celiac disease may be made. As noted above, examination of the interior wall of the intestine (upper and lower) by means of an enteroscope or colonoscope as well as obtaining intestinal biopsies to be examined under a microscope is useful, especially to determine if the symptoms are the result of intestinal disorders other than RCD. Capsule endoscopy, which examines the small intestinal lining using a camera mounted on a swallowed pill, may also be useful in evaluating the degree of small intestinal inflammation and injury.  Some specialized centers are able to offer sophisticated examinations of the biopsy materials that in many cases will assist in the diagnosis. These studies emphasize the presence of abnormal populations of T lymphocytes in the tissue indicating a diagnosis of the more aggressive Type II RCD. Other imaging studies (barium X-ray, CT scan, capsule enteroscopy and MRE) may be undertaken, especially if there is concern for the presence of a lymphoma. Several therapies for RCD have been tried in uncontrolled tests with inconclusive results. Among the therapies tested in this way are: elemental diet (an elemental diet is a liquid diet consisting of nutrients that require no digestion, including amino acids, carbohydrates, vitamins, minerals, and triglycerides); and total parental nutrition (TPN) that is defined as nutrition maintained entirely by intravenous injection or by some other nongastrointestinal route. Steroid therapy is a mainstay of treatment but its beneficial effect is short-lived in patients of lymphoma. Treatment involving other immunosuppressive drugs such as azathioprine, cyclosporine, enteric-coated budesonide, 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA), or inflixamab has been used with a limited number of patients.  More recently chemotherapy with cladribine with or without autologous stem cell transplantation has also been reported to be useful.",small intestinal inflammation and injury,SIGN
Hemimegalencephaly,"Hemimegalencephaly (HME) is a rare neurological condition in which one-half of the brain, or one side of the brain, is abnormally larger than the other. The structure of the brain on the affected side may be markedly abnormal or show only subtle changes. In either case, as a consequence of this size and structural differences, the enlarged brain tissue causes frequent seizures, often associated with cognitive or behavioral disabilities. Seizures in association with HME often begin in early infant life including an association with infantile spasms. Hemimegalencephaly may occur as an isolated or sporadic brain malformation or it may be associated with other neurodevelopmental syndromes. Thus, when detected, HME should prompt a search for other syndromic diagnoses. Hemimegalencephaly is a very rare disorder for which prevalence estimates are not available. Examination by MRI is usually sufficient to confirm a suspected case of HME. Thus, an MRI examination should be performed as soon as HME is suspected. Seizures are diagnosed and defined by electroencephalography (EEG).","cognitive or behavioral disabilities, one-half of the brain, or one side of the brain, is abnormally larger than the other, Seizures, seizures, Seizures in early infant life, enlarged brain tissue",SIGN
Mucha-Habermann-Disease,"Mucha-Habermann disease affects men more often than women. The disorder is most common in children and young adults, but can affect people of any age including newborns (with lesions present at birth) and the elderly. The incidence of Mucha-Habermann disease is unknown. A diagnosis of Mucha-Habermann disease is made based upon a thorough clinical evaluation, a detailed patient history, identification of characteristic skin lesions and, if needed for confirmation, microscopic examination (biopsy) of affected skin tissue.",skin lesions,SIGN
Autosomal-Dominant-Hyper-IgE-Syndrome,"Autosomal dominant hyper IgE syndrome (AD-HIES) is a rare multisystem primary immunodeficiency disorder. Symptoms often become apparent early during infancy or childhood. The disorder is characterized by repeated bacterial infections of the skin and lungs (pneumonia), skeletal abnormalities, and characteristic facial features. The first symptom is often the development of a dry, red flaky skin rash (eczema) at birth or early during infancy. Researchers have discovered that mutations in the STAT3 gene cause AD-HIES in over 60% of the patients. Most cases of AD-HIES occur as the result of a new mutation in this gene. There are two main forms of hyper IgE syndrome - one inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern and one in an autosomal recessive pattern. Both involve defects of the immune system and elevated levels of immunoglobulin E (hyper IgE) in the blood. For years, researchers considered them different expressions of the same disorder, but now researchers consider them similar, yet distinct disorders.","facial features, hyper IgE, skeletal abnormalities, eczema at birth or early during infancy, pneumonia, bacterial infections of the skin, defects of the immune system",SIGN
Adenylosuccinate-Lyase-Deficiency,"Adenylosuccinate lyase deficiency (ASLD) is a rare, inherited metabolic disorder due to a lack of the enzyme adenylosuccinate lyase (ASL). The defect is characterized by the appearance of two unusual chemicals, succinylaminoimidazole carboxamide riboside (SAICA riboside) and succinyladenosine, in cerebrospinal fluid, in urine and, to a much smaller extent, in plasma. These compounds, which are never found in healthy individuals, are formed from the two natural compounds acted upon by the enzyme. The symptoms and the physical findings associated with ASLD vary greatly from case to case. As a rule, patients with ASLD present with a mix of neurological symptoms that usually will include some of the following: psychomotor retardation, autistic features, epilepsy, axial hypotonia with peripheral hypertonia, muscle wasting, and secondary feeding problems. Although abnormal physical features (dysmorphism) are not common, when they do occur they may include severe growth failure, small head circumference, brachycephaly, flat occiput, prominent metopic suture, intermittent divergent strabismus, small nose with anteverted nostrils, long and smooth philtrum, thin upper lip, and low set ears.","low set ears, long and smooth philtrum, secondary feeding problems, severe growth failure, small head circumference, axial hypotonia, peripheral hypertonia, appearance of succinyladenosine in cerebrospinal fluid, in urine and, to a much smaller extent, in plasma, flat occiput, small nose with anteverted nostrils, appearance of succinylaminoimidazole carboxamide riboside in cerebrospinal fluid, in urine and, to a much smaller extent, in plasma, dysmorphism, lack of the enzyme adenylosuccinate lyase, muscle wasting, ntermittent divergent strabismus, epilepsy, autistic features, psychomotor retardation, thin upper lip, prominent metopic suture, brachycephaly",SIGN
Botulism,"Clostridium botulinum. The clinical diagnosis of botulism may be made based upon a thorough clinical evaluation and a detailed patient history. The mouse bioassay is the “gold standard” method for laboratory confirmation of the clinical diagnosis and may demonstrate the presence of botulinum toxin in serum, gastric fluid, stool, or food (foodborne botulism) specimens. Botulism can also be confirmed by culture of C. botulinum organisms from gastric fluid, stool, or a contaminated wound (wound botulism).","f C. botulinum organisms from contaminated wound, presence of botulinum toxin in serum, gastric fluid, stool",SIGN
Kohler-Disease,"Kohler disease is a rare bone disorder of the foot in children that may be the result of stress-related compression at a critical time during the period of growth. It is characterized by limping caused by pain and swelling in the foot. It most often occurs in children between the ages 3-7, and affects males five times more often than females. Usually, just one foot is affected so children typically walk on the side portion of the foot. A diagnosis of Kohler disease is suspected based on the presence of the signs of symptoms in the child. The clinical diagnosis of Kohler disease is reinforced by X-rays that show flattening, sclerosis, and fragmentation of the navicular bone, which can be compared to the unaffected side to make the diagnosis. However, these abnormalities of the navicular bone are bilateral in approximately 25% of patients and may be seen in children who do not have Kohler disease.","sclerosis of the navicular bone, abnormalities of the navicular bone, swelling in the foot, flattening of the navicular bone, fragmentation of the navicular bone",SIGN
Prune-Belly-Syndrome,"Prune-Belly syndrome, also known as Eagle-Barrett syndrome, is a rare disorder characterized by partial or complete absence of the stomach (abdominal) muscles, failure of both testes to descend into the scrotum (bilateral cryptorchidism), and/or urinary tract malformations. The urinary malformations may include abnormal widening (dilation) of the tubes that bring urine to the bladder (ureters), accumulation of urine in the ureters (hydroureter) and the kidneys (hydronephrosis), and/or backflow of urine from the bladder into the ureters (vesicoureteral reflux). Complications associated with Prune-Belly syndrome may include underdevelopment of the lungs (pulmonary hypoplasia) and/or chronic renal failure. The exact cause of Prune-Belly syndrome is not known. Prune Belly syndrome is a very rare disorder that is present at birth.  The disorder affects mostly males but a few female cases have been described in the medical literature. The diagnosis is usually obvious from birth, but care and time are required to determine the location and number of abnormalities. A full understanding of the complications will involve imaging tests such as ultrasound, X-ray, and, in order to determine the extent of involvement of the genitourinary tract, intravenous pyelogram (IVP). An IVP makes use of a dye to map the degree of involvement of the kidneys and their ducts.","urinary tract malformations, abdominal muscles partial or complete absence of the, vesicoureteral reflux, dilation of the ureters, urinary malformations, hydroureter, pulmonary hypoplasia, hydronephrosis, chronic renal failure, bilateral cryptorchidism",SIGN
Pneumocystis-Pneumonia,"Pneumocystis pneumonia is characterized by a gradual onset with shortness of breath and/or difficulty breathing. This disorder may be accompanied with fevers, night sweats, weight loss and dry cough. Dry cough is one distinction from typical pneumonia because spit (sputum) is too thick to become productive, therefore productive cough is not as common in PJP. Uncommonly, the PJP fungus can spread to other body organs such as the liver, kidney and spleen as the disease progresses. PJP is a frequent AIDS-defining diagnosis in the United States and in Europe. Pneumocystis pneumonia is commonly seen in HIV infected people with a CD4 count of less than 200 cells/mm3. People receiving high doses of glucocorticoids or other immunosuppressive drugs after an organ transplant or to treat cancer are at risk for PJP. People with other inflammatory conditions such as granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener’s), polymyositis or dermatomyositis can also have an increased risk of acquiring PJP. The diagnosis of Pneumocystis pneumonia requires multiple tests such as a chest X-ray and a sample of sputum collected by a procedure called bronchoalveolar lavage to differentiate PJP between from other causes of pneumonia. To further confirm PJP, a test to amplify trace amounts of DNA (polymerase chain reaction or PCR) is used and a blood test to detect β-D-glucan is used.","fevers, weight loss, Dry cough, shortness of breath, CD4 count of less than 200 cells/mm3, cough, dry cough, sputum, night sweats, pneumonia, sputum to become productive, difficulty breathing",SIGN
Cone-Dystrophy,"Cone dystrophy is a general term used to describe a group of rare eye disorders that affect the cone cells of the retina. Cone dystrophy can variably cause a variety of symptoms including decreased visual clarity (acuity) when looking straight ahead (central vision), a reduced ability to see colors and an increased sensitivity to light (photophobia). Cone dystrophy may be broken down into two broad groups - stationary and progressive. In stationary cone dystrophy symptoms tend to remain stable and are usually present at birth or early childhood. In progressive cone dystrophy symptoms slowly become worse over time. There are several different forms of cone dystrophy. The age of onset, progression and severity of cone dystrophy can vary greatly from one person to another, even among individuals with the same type of cone dystrophy. Some forms of cone dystrophy are inherited; other forms appear to occur spontaneously for no apparent reason (sporadically). Cone dystrophy affects males and females in equal numbers when it occurs sporadically or is inherited as an autosomal dominant or recessive trait. The X-linked recessive form of cone dystrophy only affects males fully, although some females may have mild symptoms of the disorder. The exact incidence of cone dystrophy is unknown and estimates tend to vary in the medical literature. Most sources estimate the incidence as approximately 1 in 30,000 individuals in the general population. Cone dystrophy is usually present in early infancy or during childhood or early adulthood. However, the disorder has been reported to develop in individuals of all ages including older adults.","decreased acuity central vision, photophobia, reduced ability to see colors",SIGN
Testicular-Cancer,"Testicular cancer is an uncommon form of cancer and accounts for only 1% of all cancers in men. However, it is the most common form of cancer in men between the ages of 15 and 35. Approximately 8,850 men are diagnosed with testicular cancer each year in the United States. A variety of conditions can cause signs and symptoms that are similar to those seen in testicular cancer. This can include testicular torsion, epididymitis, epididymoorchitis, hydrocele, varicocele, hematoma, spermatocele, and syphilitic gumma. Testicular torsion in when a testicle rotates and twists around the spermatic cord (a collection of vessels, nerves, and ducts that runs to and from the testicles). Epididymitis is inflammation of the long, narrow, tightly coiled tube (epididymis) found behind each testicle. The epididymis carries sperm from the testicle to the spermatic duct. Epididymoorchitis is inflammation of the epididymis and the testicles. Hydrocele occurs when fluid builds up in the sac that surrounds the testicle leading to swelling and heaviness or discomfort of the affected testicle. Varicocele is the abnormal enlargement of the veins within the scrotum that can cause a feeling of discomfort or pain and impair fertility. A hematoma is a collection or small mass made up of clotted blood. A spermatocele is a noncancerous (benign) cyst that forms close to a testicle. Syphilitic gumma is a small, growth that can form in some people with syphilis.","enlargement of the veins within the scrotum, inflammation of the the testicles, Syphilitic gumma, collection or small mass made up of clotted blood, fluid builds up in the sac that surrounds the testicle, inflammation epididymis, swelling of the affected testicle, testicle rotates and twists around the spermatic cord, impair fertility, inflammation of the epididymis",SIGN
Pachydermoperiostosis,"Pachydermoperiostosis is a rare disorder characterized by clubbing of the fingers, thickening of the skin of the face (pachyderma), and excessive sweating (hyperhidrosis). It typically appears during childhood or adolescence, often around the time of puberty, and progresses slowly for about ten years. Pachydermoperiostosis is a rare disorder that affects males more often than females with a ratio of 7:1.  This ratio may not be totally valid since females often have milder symptoms than do men, with the fibrous bone growth (periostosis) not being detected unless X-rays are taken. Diagnosis is made clinically. Major diagnostic criteria for HOA are clubbing of the fingers (digital clubbing) and fibrous bone growth (periostosis). Pachydermoperiostosis is the complete form of HOA. There are also three incomplete forms. clubbing alone, periostosis without clubbing, and pachyderma.","periostosis, pachyderma, clubbing, hyperhidrosis, clubbing of the fingers, digital clubbing",SIGN
Mitochondrial-Neurogastrointestinal-Encephalopathy,"Mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal encephalomyopathy (MNGIE) is a rare multisystem disorder characterized by progressive degeneration of the muscles of the gastrointestinal tract causing gastrointestinal dysmotility, weakness of extra-ocular muscles causing drooping of the eyelids (ptosis) and restricted eye movements (ophthalmoparesis), degeneration of peripheral nerves causing altered sensation and weakness the distal arms and legs, and general wasting (cachexia). The specific symptoms associated with MNGIE vary from case to case and may include vomiting, nausea, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and numbness or sensations of pins and needles in the hands and feet. . Additional findings may occur in some cases. MNGIE is caused by changes (mutations) in the TYMP gene encoding thymidine phosphorylase (TP) and is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait.","degeneration of peripheral nerves, ophthalmoparesis, progressive degeneration of the muscles of the gastrointestinal tract, weakness the distal arms and legs, vomiting, cachexia, gastrointestinal dysmotility, diarrhea, weakness of extra-ocular muscles, altered sensation the distal arms and legs, ptosis",SIGN

Leprosy,"Leprosy is a chronic infectious disease of humans caused by the bacteria Mycobacterium leprae.  For many years, it was considered a mysterious disorder associated with some type of curse, and persons with the disease were isolated and ostracized. Today, there is effective treatment and the disease can be cured. There is no longer any justification for isolating persons with leprosy. There are no closely related diseases. The diagnosis can usually be made by the history and characteristic findings on examination. The important findings are decreased ability to feel light touch in a skin spot, enlarged or tender nerves in the arms or legs, numbness in a hand or foot, and finding the bacteria in the skin. There may also be loss of hair in the affected skin areas. A special type of skin smear is commonly done and will demonstrate the bacteria in the skin in lepromatous and borderline lepromatous cases. The bacteria are too few in tuberculoid cases to be found in a skin smear. A skin biopsy of a lesion can also be helpful to confirm the diagnosis. There are no blood tests or skin tests at the present time that are helpful in the diagnosis.","loss of hair in the affected skin areas, decreased ability to feel light touch in a skin spot, finding the bacteria in the skin, numbness in a hand or foot, enlarged or tender nerves in the arms or legs",SIGN

Oculocerebrocutaneous-Syndrome,"Oculocerebrocutaneous (OCC) syndrome (OMIM 164180), a rare genetic disorder, is apparent at birth (congenital). The disorder is characterized primarily by eye (ocular), brain (e.g., cerebral), and skin (cutaneous) malformations. For example, many affected infants have semisolid or fluid-filled swellings (cysts) within the cavities of the skull (orbits) that accommodate the eyeballs and associated structures. In most patients, the eye on the affected side or sides is also abnormally small (microphthalmos). Brain abnormalities associated with OCC syndrome may include enlargement of the ventricular system, multiple fluid-filled spaces within and malformations of the outer region of the cerebral hemispheres (cerebral cortex), absence of the band of nerve fibers that joins the brain's hemispheres (agenesis of the corpus callosum), and a typical malformation of mid- and hindbrain. Affected infants and children often have intellectual disability and episodes of uncontrolled electrical activity in the brain (seizures). In addition, OCC syndrome is characterized by underdevelopment or absence of skin in certain localized regions (focal dermal hypoplasia or aplasia) and most have protruding, flesh-colored or brownish outgrowths of skin (cutaneous tags) within certain facial areas, including around the eyelids, on the cheeks, or near the ears. In all individuals with OCC syndrome known so far, the disorder occurs sporadically (with no family history of similar disorders). OCC syndrome has been reported more frequently in males than in females; however, the prevalence is unknown.

According to reports in the medical literature, common findings include diminished muscle tone (hypotonia) and motor incoordination; an unsteady manner of walking (gait); pronounced verbal delays; and/or certain malformations of the skull and facial (craniofacial) region. Such craniofacial abnormalities may include an unusually small head (microcephaly); vertical skin folds that may cover the eyes' inner corners (epicanthal folds); unusually large ears; and/or other malformations. Chromosome 22 Ring is usually caused by spontaneous or ""de novo"" errors very early in the development of the embryo that appear to occur randomly for unknown reasons.

Chromosome-11-Partial-Monosomy-11q,"Partial monosomy 11q, also known as Jacobsen syndrome, is a rare chromosomal disorder in which a portion of chromosome 11 is deleted (missing). The range and severity of symptoms varies, greatly depending on the exact location and size of the missing genetic material. Symptoms commonly associated with partial monosomy 11q include abnormally slow growth before and after birth (prenatal and postnatal physical growth retardation), moderate to severe delay in the acquisition of skills requiring the coordination of mental and muscular activity and intellectual disability. Rarely, individuals may have normal/borderline intelligence while most children have mild to severe intellectual disability. Characteristic physical abnormalities may include dimorphism (unusual shape) of the head and face (craniofacial), hands, feet, congenital defects of the ear, bleeding due to platelet abnormalities, and immunological defects. The exact cause of partial monosomy 11q is not fully understood. Partial monosomy 11q is an extremely rare chromosomal disorder that is apparent at birth. The disorder was initially described in the medical literature in 1973. Since that time, more than 200 cases have been described in the medical literature.

Pallister W syndrome is apparent at birth.  It is characterized by widely spaced eyes (hypertelorism) with downward slanting eyelid folds (palpebral fissures), a broad flat nasal bridge, a broad tip of the nose, a broad flat jaw, central clefting of the palate or upper lip, seizures, and mental retardation.  There may also be bone abnormalities in the arms and legs such as abnormal deviation of the elbow away from the body when the arm is extended (cubitus valgus).  Other symptoms may include hair that does not lie flat on the head (cowlick), missing teeth (partial adontia), broad uvula, and a high broad forehead.  Additional findings may include tremor and/or involuntary muscle contractions (i.e., spasticity). Pallister W syndrome is a very rare disorder.  As of  the year 2000, only six cases had been reported in the medical literature.  More than half involved male infants but the numbers are not large enough to draw any conclusions regarding whether it affects one sex more than the other. The characteristic facial features assist in the diagnosis.","cowlick, high broad forehead, partial adontia, spasticity, upper lip clefting of the, clefting of the palate, unusual facial features, broad uvula, downslanting eyelid folds, involuntary muscle contractions, broad flat nose, bone deformities of the legs, broad flat nasal bridge, seizures, speech problems, widely spaced slanted eyes, bone abnormalities in the legs, bone abnormalities in the arms, central clefting of the upper lip,, broad flat jaw, hypertelorism, central clefting of the palate, tremor, mental retardation, cubitus valgus, broad tip of the nose, bone deformities of the arms, downward slanting eyelid folds",SIGN
Horner_s-Syndrome,"Horner syndrome is a relatively rare disorder characterized by a constricted pupil (miosis), drooping of the upper eyelid (ptosis), absence of sweating of the face (anhidrosis), and sinking of the eyeball into the bony cavity that protects the eye (enophthalmos). These are the four classic signs of the disorder. Horner syndrome is a rare disorder that affects males and females in equal numbers and may occur at any age, among any ethnic grouping in any geographic location. The diagnosis of Horner syndrome and the localization of the lesions that cause the disorder can be determined by pharmacological tests combined with imaging techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging and ultrasonography of the carotid artery.","enophthalmos, miosis, of the face anhidrosis, ptosis",SIGN
Arthrogryposis-Multiplex-Congenita,"Arthrogryposis is a general or descriptive term for the development of nonprogressive contractures affecting one or more areas of the body prior to birth (congenitally). A contracture is a condition in which a joint becomes permanently fixed in a bent (flexed) or straightened (extended) position, completely or partially restricting the movement of the affected joint. When congenital contractures occur only in one body area, it is not referred to as arthrogryposis but rather an isolated congenital contracture. The most common form of an isolated congenital contracture is clubfoot. When arthrogryposis affects two or more different areas of the body, it may be referred to as arthrogryposis multiplex congenita (AMC). The most common form of AMC is amyoplasia. Arthrogryposis and arthrogryposis multiplex congenita are sometimes used interchangeably. The number of males and females affected by AMC is approximately equal. The condition has been reported in individuals of Asian, African and European descent. Isolated congenital contractures affect approximately 1 in 500 individuals in the general population. AMC affects approximately 1 in 3,000 individuals. AMC is, by definition, present at birth (congenital). A diagnosis of AMC is made based upon identification of characteristic symptoms (e.g., multiple congenital contractures), a detailed patient history, and a thorough clinical evaluation. Certain tests may be necessary to determine the underlying cause of AMC including nerve conduction, electromyography and muscle biopsy, which can help diagnose neuropathic or myopathic disorders. A nerve conduction study measures how rapidly nerves carry an electrical impulse. An electromyography is a test that records electrical activity in skeletal voluntary muscles at rest and during muscle contraction. A biopsy is a procedure in which a small amount of affected tissue (e.g., muscle) is removed and studied under a microscopic to detect characteristic changes or findings that can aid in obtaining a diagnosis. Imaging studies of the central nervous system (CNS) and comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) array, microarray, and exome studies may also be useful studies in making diagnoses. Because of the many mutations that can lead to arthrogryposis, whole genome sequencing is often required (preferable in both parents for comparison as well) to make a diagnosis.","arthrogryposis two or more different areas, congenital contractures in one body are, joint becomes permanently fixed, congenitally development of nonprogressive contractures, contracture, multiple congenital contractures",SIGN
Glycogen-Storage-Disease-Type-VII,"Glycogen storage diseases are a group of disorders in which stored glycogen cannot be metabolized into glucose to supply energy for the body. Glycogen storage disease type VII (GSD VII) is characterized by weakness, pain and stiffness during exercise.  GSD VII is caused by abnormalities in the muscle phosphofructokinase gene that results in a deficiency of the phosphofructokinase enzyme. This enzyme deficiency leads to a reduced amount of energy available to muscles during exercise.  GSD VII is inherited as an autosomal recessive genetic disorder. GSD type VII usually begins in childhood and is characterized by weakness, pain and stiffness during exercise, sometimes associated with nausea and vomiting and dark, burgundy-colored urine due to the presence of myoglobin (myoglobinuria).  Destruction of muscle tissue (rhabdomyolysis) can also occur.  A rare form of GSD type VII has been reported in infants that is associated with progressive loss of muscle tone (hypotonia), muscle weakness and death.  A late-onset form has been reported in adults who experience only muscle weakness. Glycogen storage disease type VII is a rare disorder that occurs more often in individuals of Japanese and Ashkenazi Jewish descent.  GSD type VII affects males and females in equal numbers. GSD type VII is diagnosed by a muscle biopsy for measurement of the phosphofructokinase enzyme level or measurement of the phosphofructokinase enzyme level in red blood cells. Molecular genetic testing for the phosphofructokinase gene mutations prevalent in the Ashkenazi Jewish population are available on a research basis.","rhabdomyolysis, vomiting, dark, burgundy-colored urine, death, hypotonia, reduced amount of energy available to muscles during exercise, deficiency of the phosphofructokinase enzyme, stiffness during exercise, muscle weakness, myoglobinuria",SIGN
Hypohidrotic-Ectodermal-Dysplasia,"Hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia (HED) is a rare inherited multisystem disorder that belongs to the group of diseases known as ectodermal dysplasias. Ectodermal dysplasias typically affect the hair, teeth, nails, sweat glands, and/or skin. HED is primarily characterized by partial or complete absence of certain sweat glands (eccrine glands), causing lack of or diminished sweating (anhidrosis or hypohidrosis), heat intolerance, and fever; abnormally sparse hair (hypotrichosis), and absence (hypodontia) and/or malformation of certain teeth. Many individuals with HED also have characteristic facial abnormalities including a prominent forehead, a sunken nasal bridge (so-called ""saddle nose""), unusually thick lips, and/or a large chin. The skin on most of the body may be abnormally thin, dry, and soft with an abnormal lack of pigmentation (hypopigmentation). However, the skin around the eyes (periorbital) may be darkly pigmented (hyperpigmentation) and finely wrinkled, appearing prematurely aged. In many cases, affected infants and children may also exhibit underdevelopment (hypoplasia) or absence (aplasia) of mucous glands within the respiratory and gastrointestinal (GI) tracts and, in some cases, decreased function of certain components of the immune system (e.g., depressed lymphocyte function, and rarely cellular immune hypofunction), potentially causing an increased susceptibility to certain infections and/or allergic conditions. Many affected infants and children experience recurrent attacks of wheezing and breathlessness (asthma), respiratory infections; chronic inflammation of the nasal passages (atrophic rhinitis), scaling, itchy (pruritic) skin rashes (eczema), and/or other findings.","scaling, prominent forehead, thick lips, skin thin, dry, and soft with hypopigmentation, fever, skin periorbital finely wrinkled, hypoplasia of mucous glands, eczema, appearing prematurely aged, hypotrichosis, allergic conditions, wheezing, heat intolerance, large chin, depressed lymphocyte function, partial or complete absence of eccrine glands, aplasia of mucous glands, hypodontia, malformation of certain teeth, facial abnormalities, decreased function of immune system, cellular immune hypofunction, saddle nose, respiratory infections, anhidrosis, asthma, infections, skin periorbital hyperpigmentation, hypohidrosis, atrophic rhinitis",SIGN
Blepharophimosis-Ptosis-Epicanthus-Inversus-Syndrome,"The four major features that are characteristic symptoms of BPES are present at birth: narrowing of the eye opening (blepharophimosis), droopy eyelids (ptosis), formation of an upward fold of the inner lower eyelid (epicanthus inversus) and increased distance between the eyes (telecanthus). There are two types of BPES, BPES type I and type II, which are both characterized by the typical eyelid malformation. However, BPES type I is also associated with loss of ovarian function or premature ovarian insufficiency (POI). Menstrual periods in women with POI become less frequent over time and stop before the age of 40 thus leading to either difficulty (subfertility) or inability to conceive (infertility).  Other minor facial features frequently observed in both types include “lazy” eye (amblyopia), crossed eyes (strabismus), low-set ears, a short distance between the upper lip and nose, and a broad nasal bridge. The prevalence of BPES is unknown, but there are no differences in prevalence based on ethnicity, sex, race or age.","premature ovarian insufficiency, Menstrual periods less frequent and stop before the age of 40, loss of ovarian function, epicanthus inversus at birth, ptosis at birth, short distance between the upper lip and nose, before the age of 40 infertility, before the age of 40 subfertility, amblyopia, low-set ears, blepharophimosis at birth, POI, strabismus, broad nasal bridge, telecanthus at birth, eyelid malformation",SIGN
Hereditary-Angioedema,"Hereditary angioedema is a rare disorder that affects males and females in equal numbers. Symptoms typically begin in early childhood. An estimated one in 50,000 to 150,000 individuals is affected by this disorder worldwide. The diagnosis of hereditary angioedema is made by a thorough clinical evaluation, a detailed patient history, and blood tests that detect decreased levels of complement proteins. In instances of high clinical suspicion and recurrent episodic angioedema of uncertain etiology, genetic testing is indicated.",decreased levels of complement proteins,SIGN
Myotonia-Congenita,"Myotonia congenita is a rare genetic disorder in which an abnormality of voluntary (skeletal) muscle fiber membranes causes an unusually exaggerated response to stimulation (hyperexcitability). As a result, affected individuals have difficulty relaxing certain muscles after contracting them (myotonia), muscle stiffness (rigidity), and associated symptoms. Such symptoms tend to occur when attempting to move certain muscles after rest. In many cases, individuals with myotonia congenita also have abnormal enlargement of the muscles (hypertrophy), resulting in a ""herculean"" or ""body-builder like"" appearance.","abnormality of voluntary (skeletal) muscle fiber membranes, hypertrophy, hyperexcitability, myotonia, body-builder like appearance, herculean appearance, rigidity",SIGN
Adams-Oliver-Syndrome,"Adams-Oliver syndrome (AOS) is an extremely rare inherited disorder characterized by defects of the scalp and abnormalities of the fingers, toes, arms, and/or legs. The physical abnormalities associated with this disorder vary greatly among affected individuals. Some cases may be very mild while others may be severe. In infants with Adams-Oliver syndrome, scalp defects are present at birth (congenital) and may include one or multiple hairless scarred areas that may have abnormally wide (dilated) blood vessels directly under the affected skin. In severe cases, an underlying defect of the bones of the skull may also be present. In addition, infants with this disorder typically have malformations of the hands, arms, feet, and/or legs. These range from abnormally short (hypoplastic) fingers and toes to absent hands and/or lower legs. In some cases, additional abnormalities may also be present. Most cases of AOS appear to follow autosomal dominant inheritance but autosomal recessive inheritance has also been reported. Adams-Oliver syndrome is an extremely rare disorder that appears to affect males and females in equal numbers. More than 125 affected individuals have been reported in the medical literature. The major physical features of Adams-Oliver syndrome (i.e., scalp defects and limb abnormalities) are apparent at birth (congenital). The diagnosis of Adams-Oliver syndrome may be suspected at birth based upon the identification of characteristic scalp and skull defects occurring in association with malformations of the fingers, toes, hands, and/or feet. The diagnosis may be confirmed by a thorough clinical evaluation, a detailed patient history, and a variety of specialized tests, such as advanced imaging techniques. In some cases, it may be possible to detect defects of the skull and/or limbs before birth (prenatally) through the use of advanced imaging techniques such as ultrasound. During fetal ultrasonography, reflected sound waves are used to create an image of the developing fetus.","limb abnormalities congenital, malformations of the hands, absent hands, malformations of the fingers, defects of the limbs prenatally, malformations of the toes, defects of the skull prenatally, abnormalities of the arms, scalp defects congenital, underlying defect of the bones of the skull, scalp and skull defects, hypoplastic toes, abnormalities of the legs, abnormalities of the fingers, malformations of the feet, dilated blood vessels directly under the affected ski, hypoplastic fingers, abnormalities of the toes, defects of the scalp, one or multiple hairless scarred areas, malformations of the legs, physical abnormalities, malformations of the arms, absent lower legs",SIGN
Hyperlipoproteinemia-Type-III,"Hyperlipoproteinemia type III is a genetic disorder that causes the body to breakdown (metabolize) fats (lipids) incorrectly. This results in the buildup of lipids in the body (hyperlipidemia) and can lead to the development of multiple small, yellow skin growths (xanthomas). Affected individuals may also develop the buildup of fatty materials in the blood vessels (atherosclerosis) blocking blood flow and potentially leading to heart attack or stroke. Hyperlipoproteinemia type III affects 1-5,000 to 1 in 10,000 people in the general population. Without treatment, affected individuals are 5-10 times more likely to develop cardiovascular disease.","atherosclerosis, hyperlipidemia, stroke, heart attack, xanthomas, lipids incorrectly metabolize",SIGN
Oculocerebral-Syndrome-with-Hypopigmentation,"Oculocerebral Syndrome with Hypopigmentation is an extremely rare inherited disorder characterized by the lack of normal color (hypopigmentation) of the skin and hair and abnormalities of the central nervous system that affect the eyes and certain parts of the brain (oculocerebral). Physical findings at birth include unusually light skin color and silvery-gray hair. Abnormal findings associated with the central nervous system may include abnormal smallness of one or both eyes (microphthalmia); clouding (opacities) of the front, clear portion of the eye through which light passes (cornea); and/or rapid, involuntary eye movements (nystagmus). Additional symptoms that may develop during infancy include involuntary muscle contractions, associated loss of muscle function (spastic paraplegia), developmental delays, and/or mental retardation. Oculocerebral Syndrome with Hypopigmentation is believed to be inherited as an autosomal recessive genetic trait.","nystagmus, silvery-gray hair, opacities of the cornea, microphthalmia, light skin color, developmental delays, mental retardation, spastic paraplegia, abnormalities of the central nervous system oculocerebral, hypopigmentation, involuntary muscle contractions",SIGN
Kearns-Sayre-Syndrome,"Kearns-Sayre syndrome (KSS) is a rare neuromuscular disorder.  An important clinical symptomatic feature is the presence of a mono-or bilateral ptosis (partial closure of the eyelids). This disease is mostly characterized by three primary findings: progressive paralysis of certain eye muscles (chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia [CPEO]); abnormal accumulation of colored (pigmented) material on the nerve-rich membrane lining the eyes (atypical retinitis pigmentosa), leading to chronic inflammation, progressive degeneration, and wearing-away of certain eye structures (pigmentary degeneration of the retina); and heart disease (cardiomyopathy) such as heart block. Other findings may include muscle weakness, short stature, hearing loss, and/or the loss of ability to coordinate voluntary movements (ataxia) due to problems affecting part of the brain (cerebellum). In some cases, KSS may be associated with other disorders and/or conditions.","progressive degeneration, pigmentary degeneration of the retina, chronic inflammation, ataxia, cardiomyopathy, short stature, heart block, chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia, atypical retinitis pigmentos, hearing loss, mono-or bilateral ptosis, muscle weakness",SIGN
Functional-Neurological-Disorder,"Functional neurological disorder (FND) is a medical condition in which there is a problem with the functioning of the nervous system and how the brain and body sends and/or receives signals, rather than a structural disease process such as multiple sclerosis or stroke.

VACTERL-with-Hydrocephalus,VACTERL with hydrocephalus is an extremely rare genetic disorder in which the multisystem features of VACTERL association occur in addition to hydrocephalus. The term VACTERL is an acronym with each letter representing the first letter of the more common findings seen in affected children: VACTERL with hydrocephalus is an extremely rare disorder that affects males and females in equal numbers. The exact prevalence of the disorder in the general population is unknown. A diagnosis may be made based upon a complete physical exam and a variety of specialized tests to look for the major and minor features of VACTERL association occurring along with hydrocephalus.,hydrocephalus,SIGN
Rapid,"Rapid-onset obesity with hypothalamic dysfunction, hypoventilation, and autonomic dysregulation (ROHHAD) is a rare disorder of respiratory control and autonomic nervous system (ANS) regulation, with endocrine system abnormalities. Respiratory control is the automatic function of breathing in response to varied activities of daily living (ex. exercise, sleep, eating), so within the context of the ANS. The ANS is the portion of the nervous system that controls or regulates many involuntary body functions including heart rate, blood pressure, temperature regulation, bowel and bladder control, breathing, and more. The endocrine system is regulated by the hypothalamus, and through hormones it controls growth, energy and water balance, sexual maturation and fertility as well as response to stress. The diagnosis of ROHHAD is currently based on clinical criteria and though investigation of genetic mutations is underway, no specific cause for ROHHAD has been found to date. ROHHAD is a very rare disorder with approximately 100 cases reported in the literature and clinically to date. Though first described under a different name in 1965, it was not re-named until 2007 nor shown to be distinct from CCHS (documented absence of CCHS-related PHOX2B mutations). Therefore, as ROHHAD is a relatively “new” disorder without many cases identified thus far, it is not yet clear if any certain population is at greater risk for developing ROHHAD.  Because of the explosion of exogenous obesity worldwide, a very high level of vigilance in consideration of ROHHAD is essential. Congenital central hypoventilation syndrome (CCHS) is a disorder of the ANS caused by a gene mutation in the PHOX2B gene that affects the embryologic development of the ANS. Similar to ROHHAD, the “automatic” control of breathing, heart -beat, digestion, and other features of ANSD are among the affected features. In CCHS, the hallmark is hypoventilation while sleeping and, in severe cases, hypoventilation while awake and asleep – despite anatomically normal heart, lung, and airways. Both CCHS and ROHHAD fall within the rubric of respiratory and autonomic disorders of infancy, childhood, and adulthood (RADICA). CCHS is a rare disorder with approximately 1,000 cases described worldwide.  Numbers of reported CCHS cases continue to grow, likely because of increased awareness and introduction of a clinically available genetic test (in 2003) – allowing for early diagnosis and improved treatment. CCHS is often diagnosed in the newborn period because of breathing problems, but milder forms of CCHS may go undiagnosed through infancy, childhood, and even adulthood. A simple blood test can be done to look for a PHOX2B gene mutation (PHOX2B is the disease-defining gene for CCHS). Different types of mutations can occur in this gene which will determine how severely an individual with CCHS is affected. Stepwise testing for PHOX2B mutations should be done with close involvement by a physician and genetic counselor.

Chromosome-7-Partial-Monosomy-7p,"Chromosome 7, Partial Monosomy 7p is a rare chromosomal disorder characterized by deletion (monosomy) of a portion of the short arm (p) of chromosome 7 (7p). Associated symptoms and findings may be variable and may depend on the specific size and location of the deleted segment of 7p. However, in many cases, there is early closure of the fibrous joints (cranial sutures) between certain bones of the skull (craniosynostosis), resulting in an abnormally shaped head. For example, depending on the specific sutures involved, the forehead may appear unusually ""triangular shaped"" (trigonocephaly) or the head may seem abnormally long and narrow with the top pointed or conical (turricephaly). Affected infants and children may also have additional malformations of the skull and facial (craniofacial) region. Such abnormalities may include an unusually small head (microcephaly), closely or widely set eyes (ocular hypotelorism or hypertelorism), downslanting eyelid folds (palpebral fissures), and/or other findings. Chromosome 7, Partial Monosomy 7p is a rare chromosomal disorder that appears to affect males and females in relatively equal numbers.  More than 30 cases have been reported in the medical literature. Additional chromosomal disorders may be characterized by symptoms and findings similar to those associated with Chromosome 7, Partial Monosomy 7p.  Chromosomal testing is necessary to confirm the specific chromosomal abnormality present.

Hemophagocytic-Lymphohistiocytosis,"Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is a rare, life-threatening condition caused by an overactive, abnormal response of the immune system. The immune system is the body’s natural defense system against foreign or invading organisms or substances. The immune system is a complex network of cells, tissues, organs, and proteins that work together to keep the body healthy. In hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, the immune system responds to a stimulus or ‘trigger’, often an infection, but the response is ineffective and abnormal. This ineffective, abnormal response, causes a variety of signs and symptoms, which, if not treated, can potentially become life-threatening. Some affected individuals may have a genetic predisposition to developing hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. This is known as the primary or familial form. In other individuals, the disorder occurs sporadically usually when there is an underlying predisposing condition or disorder. This is known as the secondary form. The secondary forms are more common than the familial forms. Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis most often affects infants from birth to 18 months, but can affect individuals of any age. Early diagnosis and prompt treatment is essential. Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis most often affects infants or young children, but can affect individuals of any age. It affects boys and girls in equal numbers. In adults, it affects men slightly more often than women. The exact incidence and prevalence is unknown. Rare disorders often go misdiagnosed or undiagnosed making it difficult to determine the true frequency in the general population.

Osteosarcoma,"Osteosarcoma is a form of cancer. It is a type of tumor that affects the bones. Osteosarcoma can affect people at any age, but is most common during the teen-aged years, and is the most common bone cancer affecting children and adolescents under the age of 20. The long bones of the legs, usually near where they connect to the knees, and the upper long bone of the arms, near where this bone meets the shoulders are the most common sites for osteosarcoma formation. Symptoms will vary depending upon the exact location and extent of disease. Pain is the most common symptom of osteosarcoma and there is often a mass or bump that can be felt (palpable). Eighty percent of individuals present with localized disease, which means the cancer remains in the area it first developed. Osteosarcoma can spread (metastasize) to other areas of the body, most likely the lungs. The exact cause is unknown in most individuals, but osteosarcoma can be induced by radiation. Most individuals are treated with a combination of chemotherapy and surgery. Sometimes, radiation therapy may be used. There are estimated to be about 750-1,000 new individuals diagnosed with osteosarcoma each year in the United States. About 450 of those are children or adolescents under the age of 20. Osteosarcoma is a rare disorder, but it is the most common cause of bone cancer in children and adolescents. These tumors usually affect individuals in their second decade of life (10-19 years of age), most often between 13 and 16 years of age, which most likely coincides with adolescent growth spurts. There is a second increase in the number of people with osteosarcoma in people over the age of 60. Overall, osteosarcoma accounts for about 1% of all cancers diagnosed each year in the United States.

Glycogen-Storage-Disease-Type-IX,"The autosomal recessive forms of glycogen storage disease IX affect males and females in equal numbers. The X-linked forms primarily affect males, although females can have symptoms, such as enlargement of the liver and, more rarely, females can have symptoms similar to those seen in males. GSD-IX types A, B and C are estimated to affect 1 in 100,000 individuals in the general population. These disorders account for approximately 25% of all glycogen storage disorders making GSD-IX one of the most common forms of these disorders. Because some affected individuals go undiagnosed or misdiagnosed, it is difficult to determine the true frequency of GSD-IX in the general population. GSD-IXd is extremely rare and its prevalence is unknown.",enlargement of the liver,SIGN
Acquired-Lipodystrophy,"Acquired lipodystrophy is a general term for types of lipodystrophy that are not inherited, but rather acquired at some point during life. Acquired lipodystrophies do not have a direct genetic cause, but rather many different factors may be involved. Acquired lipodystrophies can be caused by medications, autoimmunity or for unknown reasons (idiopathic). Subtypes of acquired lipodystrophy include acquired generalized lipodystrophy (Lawrence syndrome), acquired partial lipodystrophy (Barraquer-Simons syndrome), localized lipodystrophy, and high active antiretroviral induced lipodystrophy, which may develop in HIV-infected individuals undergoing a specific form of treatment. Onset of acquired forms of lipodystrophy can occur during childhood, adolescence or adulthood. Affected individuals develop characteristic loss of body fat (adipose tissue) affecting specific areas of the body, especially the arms, legs, face, neck, and chest or thoracic regions. In some cases, metabolic complications associated with insulin resistance can develop. Such complications include an inability to break down glucose (glucose intolerance), elevated levels of triglycerides (a type of fat) in the blood (hypertriglyceridemia), and diabetes. Additional symptoms such as fat accumulation in the liver (fatty liver or hepatic steatosis) may also occur. AGL and APL generally affect women more than men, although this may be due in part to ascertainment bias because women tend to be more severely affected and more easily recognized. APL has been reported in approximately 250 individuals with a male to female ratio of 1:4. It has been reported in individuals of various different ethnicities. AGL has been reported in approximately 100 individuals with a male to female ratio of 1:3. Most cases have been reported in Caucasians. LD-HIV is estimated to affect approximately 100,000 individuals in the United States. Consistent with the increase prevalence of HIV in males, LD-HIV is also more prevalent in males.","glucose intolerance, loss of body fat, fatty liver, hepatic steatosis, diabetes, hypertriglyceridemia, insulin resistance",SIGN
X-linked-Lymphoproliferative-Syndrome,"X-linked lymphoproliferative (XLP) syndrome is an extremely rare inherited (primary) immunodeficiency disorder characterized by a defective immune system that is powerfully responsive to infection with the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). This virus is common among the general population and is relatively well-known because it is the cause of infectious mononucleosis (IM), usually with no long-lasting effects. However, in individuals with XLP, exposure to EBV may result in severe, life-threatening fulminant hepatitis; abnormally low levels of antibodies in the blood and body secretions (hypogammaglobulinemia), resulting in increased susceptibility to various infections; malignancies of certain types of lymphoid tissue (B-cell lymphomas); and/or other abnormalities. The range of symptoms and findings associated with XLP may vary considerably from case to case. In addition, the range of effects may change in an affected individual over time. In most cases, individuals with XLP experience an onset of symptoms anytime from ages about 6 months to 10 years of age. X-linked lymphoproliferative syndrome is an extremely rare disorder that is usually fully expressed in males only.  About 400± cases affecting males in more than 80 multigenerational families (kindreds) from several different countries have been reported in the medical literature.  Researchers estimate that approximately one to two in every one million males are affected by XLP.","hepatitis, defective immune system, hypogammaglobulinemia",SIGN
Acute-Disseminated-Encephalomyelitis,"ADEM can develop at any age, but is much more frequent in children than adults. Males and females are affected in equal numbers, although a slight male preponderance was seen in a couple pediatric studies. In children, the mean at presentation is between 5-8 years old. The exact incidence of ADEM in the general population is unknown. One study conducted in San Diego, California estimated the incidence of ADEM in persons under 20 years of age at .4 per 100,000. ADEM seems to peak in the winter and spring months in studies conducted in the United States. A diagnosis of ADEM is made based upon identification of characteristic symptoms, a detailed patient history, a thorough clinical evaluation and a variety of specialized tests including imaging techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). An MRI uses a magnetic field and radio waves to produce cross-sectional images of particular organs and bodily tissues and can demonstrate characteristic brain lesions in individuals with ADEM. Additional tests to exclude other conditions may also be performed. Such tests may include infectious, immunologic, and metabolic tests.",brain lesions,SIGN
Renal-Cell-Carcinoma,"Renal cell carcinoma is a form of kidney cancer. Some patients with renal cell carcinoma do not have symptoms (asymptomatic). When symptoms are present, they may include blood in the urine; urine that is brown or rusty-colored; abdominal pain; weight loss; enlargement of one testicle or varicose veins of the testis (varicocele) in a male patient; fever; a thin, malnourished appearance; vision abnormalities; and elevated blood pressure. The most common feature of the syndrome is the passing of blood in the urine (hematuria). Renal cell carcinoma is more common in males than in females (ratio of 2 or 3 to 1) and in persons with a history of smoking.  It is also more common in persons with other types of kidney disorders and tends to run in some families.  Renal cell carcinoma accounts for approximately 30,000 new cases of kidney malignancies per year in the United States. Imaging studies, typically computerized tomography (CT) and abdominal ultrasonography (USG), are used in the diagnosis of renal cell carcinoma. Blood and urine testing may also be helpful.","weight loss, urine that is brown or rusty-colored, varicocele, thin, malnourished appearance, vision abnormalities, blood in the urine, fever, enlargement of one testicle, elevated blood pressure, hematuria",SIGN
Dextrocardia-with-Situs-Inversus,"Dextrocardia with Situs Inversus is a rare heart condition characterized by abnormal positioning of the heart. In this condition, the tip of the heart (apex) is positioned on the right side of the chest. Additionally, the position of the heart chambers as well as the visceral organs such as the liver and spleen is reversed (situs inversus). However, most affected individuals can live a normal life without associated symptoms or disability. Electrocardiography reveals an inversion of the electrical waves from the heart and is the diagnostic measure of choice. Dextrocardia with Situs Inversus is present at birth.  The condition affects males and females in equal numbers. Treatment of Dextrocardia with Situs Inversus is symptomatic and supportive when needed. In most cases, affected individuals can live a normal life without any symptoms or discomfort. If the condition is associated with other more serious heart malformations, the prognosis and treatment will vary. Genetic counseling may be helpful for affected families.","abnormal positioning of the heart, apex positioned on the right side of the chest, situs inversus, serious heart malformations",SIGN
Sturge-Weber-Syndrome,"SWS affects males and females in equal numbers. The exact incidence and prevalence is unknown. One estimate places the incidence at 1 in 20,000-50,000 live births. Approximately 3 in 1,000 babies are born with a port-wine birthmark, but only approximately 6% of individuals with a port-wine birthmark on the face develop the neurological abnormalities associated with SWS. The risk increases to 26% when the port-wine birthmark is on the forehead, temple region or upper part of the face. SWS can affect individuals of any race or ethnicity.",neurological abnormalities,SIGN
Appendiceal-Cancer-and-Tumors,"Appendiceal cancer is very rare with approximately 1-2 cases per 1 million individuals. Appendiceal cancers can occur at any age, with the peak occurrence in the 6th decade (average age of 50 at diagnosis). Most studies report that men and women are affected in equal numbers, while a few have suggested a slightly increased frequency in women. Peritoneal carcinomatosis is the spread and growth of cancer cells in the abdominal cavity. Cancers that are most frequently associated with peritoneal carcinomatosis include the gastrointestinal (colon, rectal, appendiceal, gastric, pancreas, small bowel and gallbladder) and the gynecologic (ovarian, primary peritoneal, and uterine) cancers. Other cancers that can spread to the abdominal cavity include breast, esophagus, and melanoma. Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) are a subtype of sarcoma of the intestine that can also present with multiple cancer tumors in the abdomen. Peritoneal mesothelioma is a cancer that originates in the lining of the abdominal cavity (peritoneum) and presents with signs and symptoms of peritoneal carcinomatosis. Because there are no unique features of appendiceal cancer on imaging studies such as ultrasound, CT scan, PET scan or MRI, the actual diagnosis of appendiceal cancer cannot be made until a tumor specimen is examined by a pathologist. This is frequently accomplished at the time of appendectomy for appendicitis, surgery for an intestinal blockage or presumed ovarian cancer, or through a diagnostic tumor biopsy performed for an abnormal clinical or radiographic finding such as a palpable tumor or tumors seen on an imaging study. The finding of a dilated, mucin filled appendix on CT scan or MRI should prompt concern for an appendiceal tumor and an appendectomy should be considered. The different types of appendiceal tumors and cancers can be distinguished by the appearance of the cells under the microscope and by staining them for specific markers. Goblet cell carcinoid tumors tend to be easier to identify because of the unique combination of neuroendocrine and epithelial cells.","multiple cancer tumors in the abdomen, peritoneal carcinomatosis, Peritoneal carcinomatosis, signs and symptoms of peritoneal carcinomatosis",SIGN
OSMED-Heterozygous,"Heterozygous OSMED (oto-spondyl-megaepiphyseal dysplasia) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by skeletal malformations resulting in shortening of the upper limbs and thighs and short stature (rhizomelic dwarfism). Additional symptoms include distinctive facial features and delays in psychomotor development. After the initial period of growth deficiency, affected individuals experience gradual improvement in bone growth that leads to normal physical development by early childhood. Mental and motor development is also normal by early childhood. In some cases, affected individuals develop hearing loss. Heterozygous OSMED occurs because of disruptions or changes (mutations) to the COL11A2 gene. A diagnosis of heterozygous OSMED is made based upon a thorough clinical evaluation, a detailed patient history, identification of characteristic symptoms, and a variety of specialized tests including x-rays. X-ray studies reveal characteristic skeletal malformations associated with heterozygous OSMED.","delays in psychomotor development, shortening of the upper limbs and thighs, distinctive facial features, hearing loss, rhizomelic dwarfism, growth deficiency, skeletal malformations",SIGN
Holoprosencephaly,"Holoprosencephaly (HPE) is the failure of the prosencephalon, or forebrain, to develop normally. The forebrain is a region of the brain in the fetus that develops into parts of the adult brain, including the cerebral cortex. Instead of the normal complete separation of the left and right halves of the forebrain, there is an abnormal continuity between the two sides. There are several different types of holoprosencephaly. In the alobar form, there is no separation between the right and left halves at all. In semilobar HPE, at least some separation of the two halves is present. In the lobar form, most of the brain has separated into right and left sides, though there is incomplete division into the two halves. Holoprosencephaly affects males and females in equal numbers before birth and has been reported in many ethnic groups. The incidence of holoprosencephaly has been estimated at 1 in 250 during early embryonic development, and approximately 1 in 16,000 live births.","incomplete division into the two halves, no separation between the right and left halves, most of the brain has separated into right and left sides, failure of the prosencephalon, or forebrain, to develop normally, some separation of the two halves is present",SIGN
Acidemia-Isovaleric,"Isovaleric Acidemia is a hereditary metabolic disorder. It is characterized by a deficiency of the enzyme isovaleryl CoA dehydrogenase. The disorder occurs in both an acute and a chronic intermittent form. In the acute form of Isovaleric Acidemia, vomiting, refusal to eat, and listlessness usually occur. With treatment and low protein diet, the disorder becomes chronically intermittent, and a nearly normal life is possible. Isovaleric Acidemia is a genetic disorder inherited through autosomal  recessive genes.  Symptoms are the result of a deficiency of the enzyme  isovaleric co-enzyme A (CoA) dehydrogenase, which is needed for the breakdown  of the amino acid leucine.  Human traits, including the classic genetic diseases, are the product of the interaction of two genes for that condition, one received from the father and one from the mother.  In recessive disorders, the condition does not appear unless a person inherits the same defective gene for the same trait from each parent.  If an individual receives one normal gene and one gene for the disease, the person will be a carrier for the disease, but generally will not show symptoms of the disorder. The risk of  transmitting the disease to the children of a couple, both of whom are carriers for a recessive disorder, is 25 percent.  On average, fifty percent of their children will be carriers of the disease, while 25 percent will receive a normal copy of the gene from each parent for that trait.  The risks are the same for each pregnancy. Isovaleric Acidemia is a rare disorder affecting males and females in equal numbers, usually beginning during infancy.","deficiency of the enzyme  isovaleric co-enzyme A (CoA) dehydrogenase, vomiting, deficiency of the enzyme isovaleryl CoA dehydrogenase",SIGN
Swyer-syndrome,"Swyer syndrome affects girls who have an XY chromosomal makeup, no ovaries, but functional female organs including the uterus, fallopian tubes and vagina. The exact incidence is unknown. One estimate placed the incidence at 1 in 80,000 births. Another estimate placed the incidence of Swyer syndrome (complete gonadal dysgenesis) and partial gonadal dysgenesis combined at 1 in 20,000 births. Genital anomalies in general occur in approximately 1 in 4,500 births.","Genital anomalies, no ovaries",SIGN
Hyperostosis-Frontalis-Interna,"Hyperostosis Frontalis Interna is characterized by the thickening of the frontal bone of the skull. It is not clear that this disorder is actually rare. Some clinicians believe that it may be a common abnormality found in as many as 12 percent of the female population. The disorder may be found associated with a variety of conditions such as seizures, headaches, obesity, diabetes insipidus, excessive hair growth and sex gland disturbances. Increased serum alkaline phosphatase and elevated serum calcium may occur. Hyperostosis Frontalis Interna affects females 9 times more often than males. This disorder presents itself most often among the middle-aged and elderly but has also been found in adolescents.","thickening of the frontal bone of the skull, obesity, sex gland disturbances, Increased serum alkaline phosphatase, excessive hair growth, elevated serum calcium, seizures, diabetes insipidus",SIGN
Primary-Familial-Brain-Calcification,"To date, no specific treatment for PFBC is known.

Scleroderma,"Scleroderma is a rare autoimmune connective tissue disorder characterized by abnormal thickening of the skin. Connective tissue is composed of collagen, which supports and binds other body tissues. There are several types of scleroderma. Some types affect certain, specific parts of the body, while other types can affect the whole body and internal organs (systemic). Scleroderma is also known as progressive systemic sclerosis. The exact cause of scleroderma is unknown. The systemic form of scleroderma is thought to affect from 40,000 to 165,000 people in the United States. The disease is three to four times more common in females than in males. Scleroderma may occur at any age but the symptoms most frequently begin during midlife.",thickening of the skin,SIGN
Degos-Disease,"Degos disease is an extremely rare disorder in which small and medium sized arteries become blocked (occlusive arteriopathy), restricting the flow of blood to affected areas. Degos disease usually causes characteristic skin lesions that may last for a period of time ranging from weeks to years. In some individuals, Degos disease will be limited to the skin (benign cutaneous Degos disease); other individuals will also develop symptoms affecting other organ systems (systemic Degos disease). Systemic Degos disease is most frequently characterized by lesions in the small intestine, but other organs are also affected. Major symptoms may include abdominal pain, diarrhea, and/or weight loss. The systemic form of Degos disease can cause life-threatening complications such as perforated bowels leading to inflammation of the abdominal cavity (peritonitis). The exact cause of Degos disease is unknown. A diagnosis of Degos disease is made based upon a thorough clinical evaluation, a detailed patient history, identification of characteristic findings (e.g., skin lesions), and microscopic examination of affected skin tissue that reveal distinctive changes to that tissue. Because most tests are normal, no specific laboratory test can be used to aid in the diagnosis of Degos disease.","weight loss, skin lesions, occlusive arteriopathy, restricting the flow of blood, perforated bowels, diarrhea, peritonitis",SIGN
Dyskeratosis-Congenita,"Dyskeratosis congenita is a rare genetic form of bone marrow failure, the inability of the marrow to produce sufficient blood cells. Dyskeratosis is Latin and means the irreversible degeneration of skin tissue, and congenita means inborn. First described in the medical literature in 1906, dyskeratosis congenita was originally thought to be a skin disease that also affects the nails and the mouth. Only later in the sixties was it realized that patients with these skin changes almost always develop bone marrow failure. Thus, for the last 40 years or so, the bone marrow failure syndrome dyskeratosis congenita was diagnosed when patients presented with the triad of abnormal skin, malformation (dystrophy) of the nails, and white, thickened patches on the mucous membranes of the mouth (oral leukoplakia). The skin changes may be present before the development of bone marrow failure. Bone marrow failure is usually diagnosed by the low number of circulating blood cells including red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. Additional findings in patients with dyskeratosis congenita may include short stature, eye and tooth abnormalities, thin and early graying of the hair, lung (pulmonary) disease, liver disease, gut abnormalities, bone thinning (osteoporosis), infertility, learning difficulties, and delays in reaching developmental milestones. An increased incidence of leukemia and cancer has also been documented. The prevalence or incidence of dyskeratosis congenita is difficult to assess. In a population of patients with bone marrow failure about 2-5% of patients have bone marrow failure due to dyskeratosis congenita. In patients with pulmonary fibrosis similarly 2-5% are thought to be due to mutations in TERC or TERT. In families with an increased frequency of bone marrow failure and/or lung disease, dyskeratosis congenita should be excluded as a possible cause of their disease.","irreversible degeneration of skin tissue, low number of circulating blood cells, short stature, infertility, eye abnormalities, thin and early graying of the hair, tooth abnormalities, bone marrow failure, gut abnormalities, abnormal skin, dystrophy of the nails, liver disease, pulmonary disease, learning difficulties, oral leukoplakia, inability of the marrow to produce sufficient blood cells, delays in reaching developmental milestones, osteoporosis, Bone marrow failure",SIGN
Medullary-Sponge-Kidney,"Medullary Sponge Kidney is a rare disorder characterized by the formation of cystic malformations in the collecting ducts and the tubular structures within the kidneys (tubules) that collect urine. One or both kidneys may be affected. The initial symptoms of this disorder may include blood in the urine (hematuria), calcium stone formation in the kidneys (nephrolithiasis) or infection. The exact cause of Medullary Sponge Kidney is not known. The exact cause of Medullary Sponge Kidney is not known and most cases occur sporadically for no apparent reason.  Some cases are thought to run in families (familial) and may be inherited as an autosomal dominant genetic trait.  However, this inheritance pattern has not been proven.  Some studies have suggested there may be a a possible relationship between overactivity of the parathyroid gland (Hyperparathyroidism) and Medullary Sponge Kidney. Medullary Sponge Kidney is a rare disorder that affects slightly more women than men.  It is thought to occur in 1 in 1,000 to 5,000 people in the United States.  Although the symptoms of Medullary Sponge Kidney may begin at any age, they usually develop during adolescence or in adults between the ages of 30 and 50 years.  Approximately 13 percent of all people who develop kidney stones are eventually diagnosed with Medullary Sponge Kidney. Medullary Sponge Kidney may also develop in people with Beckwith-Wiedemann Syndrome.

Hydrocephalus,"Hydrocephalus is a condition in which abnormally widened (dilated) cerebral spaces in the brain (ventricles) inhibit the normal flow of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The cerebrospinal fluid accumulates in the skull and puts pressure on the brain tissue. An enlarged head in infants and increased cerebrospinal fluid pressure are frequent findings but are not necessary for the diagnosis of Hydrocephalus. There are several different forms of Hydrocephalus: communicating hydrocephalus, non-communicating hydrocephalus or obstructive hydrocephalus, internal hydrocephalus, normal pressure hydrocephalus, and benign hydrocephalus. Most cases of Hydrocephalus are diagnosed in the first 2 years of life, but onset may occur at any age, depending on the cause.  Most types of Hydrocephalus (with the exception of those caused by an X-linked genetic trait) seem to affect males and females equally.","hydrocephalus, pressure on the brain tissue, cerebrospinal fluid accumulates in the skul, increased cerebrospinal fluid pressure, dilated ventricles, enlarged head, inhibit the normal flow of cerebrospinal fluid",SIGN
Muscular-Dystrophy-Becker,"Becker muscular dystrophy is in the category of inherited muscle wasting diseases caused by a gene abnormality (mutation) that results in deficient or abnormal production of the dystrophin protein (dystrophinopathies). The abnormal gene is called DMD and is located on the X chromosome. Becker muscular dystrophy follows x-linked recessive inheritance so it mostly affects males, but some females are affected. Becker muscular dystrophy usually begins in the teens or early twenties and symptoms vary greatly between affected individuals. Muscle deterioration progresses slowly but usually results in the need for a wheel chair. Muscles of the heart deteriorate (cardiomyopathy) in some affected individuals, and this process can become life-threatening. Learning disabilities involving visual abilities may be present. Becker muscular dystrophy occurs in approximately 1 in 30,000 male births. The diagnosis of Becker muscular dystrophy is based on physical symptoms, family history, an elevated concentration of creatine kinase (CK) in the blood indicating destruction of muscle, and molecular genetic testing. DMD is the only gene that has been associated with Becker muscular dystrophy and many different types of DMD gene mutations have been identified in individuals with this condition. Identification of a DMD gene mutation from molecular genetic testing confirms the diagnosis. If molecular genetic testing is performed and a DMD gene mutation is not found, a skeletal muscle biopsy is recommended to examine the appearance of the dystrophin protein.","cardiomyopathy, need for a wheel chair, dystrophinopathies, elevated concentration of creatine kinase (CK) in the blood, destruction of muscle, Muscle deterioration",SIGN
Mesenteric-Panniculitis,"The epidemiology of mesenteric panniculitis has not been fully defined. A recent study reported that findings consistent with mesenteric panniculitis occurred in 359 patients (0.24%) from a total of 147,794 abdominal computed tomography (CT) examinations undertaken for over a 5-year period in a large community based medical system. Of these, 100 patients (28%) had known malignancy or were later diagnosed with cancer. In some reports, mesenteric panniculitis has a male predominance of 2:1. Mesenteric panniculitis most often appears during the sixth and seventh decade of life, and its incidence appears to increase with age. Children and adolescents are less commonly affected, possibly related to a lesser amount of fat in their mesentery, but more importantly because of specific characteristics of this form of autoimmunity. Symptoms of the mesenteric panniculitis mimic those of a number of other benign and malignant conditions. Because of this, it is important to rule out other diseases prior to confirming the diagnosis of mesenteric panniculitis. Infectious causes range from viral, bacterial (including V. cholerae) and parasitic infections. There are also a variety of diseases that are associated with mesenteric abnormalities on abdominal imaging. Such conditions include primary or metastatic mesentery cancer, gastrointestinal lymphoma, desmoid tumors, inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis), Crohn’s disease, idiopathic nodular panniculitis, locally advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma, retroperitoneal fibrosis and other sclerotic diseases as mentioned above.","inflammation of the pancreas, mesenteric abnormalities",SIGN
Kasabach,"Kasabach-Merritt phenomenon (KMP) is a rare condition that is associated with a coagulopathy with features including profound thrombocytopenia (low platelets), hypofibrinogenemia (low fibrinogen), and anemia. This phenomenon is only associated  with two rare vascular tumors: kaposiform hemangioendotheliomas and tufted angiomas.  This condition can be life threatening secondary to the risk of bleeding and progression to DIC (disseminated intravascular coagulopathy). Initially a vascular lesion is noted on the skin which can be firm, indurated and purpuric.  Areas of petechiae (tiny red dots) can appear around the lesion or on other parts of the body.  If the vascular lesion is internal, these petechiae can be seen on the skin.  Bruising and spontaneous bleeding can also occur.  These tumors are not hemangiomas.  They usually present in young infants, less than three months of age, but have rarely been reported in older children.  These tumors occur in the extremities, chest, neck, abdomen and pelvis.  They infiltrate across tissue plans and can be aggravated by interventions, infection and trauma.  When these tumors with KMP are internal such as in the pleural or retroperitoneum, they can cause significant morbidity and mortality.  The morbidity and mortality is caused by bleeding. The cause of Kasabach-Merritt phenomenon is unknown. It is believed to be secondary to sequestration or trapping of platelets into the tumor.  These tumors are made up of abnormal endothelial cells (spindle cells) and also lymphatic malformation.  It is unclear why the KMP occurs and if it is caused by the spindle cells or the lymphatic component. Kasabach-Merritt phenomenon is a rare disorder that affects males and females equally The diagnosis is most often made during infancy but older children have been reported with this phenomenon.  KHE and TA tumors can occur without KMP.  The reason for this is still unknown and may be secondary to a smaller size of the tumor, an older age at presentation or other clinical features. The diagnosis of Kasabach-Merritt phenomenon is based on the diagnosis of Kaposiform hemangioendothelioma/tufted angioma and this coagulopathy as noted above.  If this diagnosis is suspected blood work including a CBC with differential and platelets, fibrinogen, D-dimer, PT, and PTT should be ordered. The best imaging modality to assess the extent of the lesion is a MRI with contrast. A biopsy will confirm the diagnosis.","spontaneous bleeding, vascular lesion, skin firm, indurated and purpuric, Kaposiform hemangioendothelioma, thrombocytopenia, anemia, tufted angioma, hypofibrinogenemia, tumors in the extremities, pelvis tumors in the, tiny red dots, bleeding, petechiae on the skin, tumors in the abdomen, lesion, tumors, tumors in the chest, coagulopathy, tumors in the neck, disseminated intravascular coagulopathy, Bruising",SIGN
Leber-Hereditary-Optic-Neuropathy,"Leber hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON) is mainly characterized by bilateral, painless subacute loss of central vision during young adult life. In most cases, symptoms begin with one eye first, followed a few weeks later by visual failure in the other eye. Extremely rarely there may be neurologic abnormalities, such as peripheral neuropathy, postural tremor, nonspecific myopathy, and movement disorders. LHON is caused by mutations in mitochondrial DNA and it is transmitted by maternal inheritance. LHON affects approximately 1:50,000 people. Many carriers never suffer significant visual loss; males are about four to five times more likely than females to be affected. LHON affects both males and females and can only be inherited from a female. The birth prevalence of LHON is approximately 1 in 50,000 people. LHON is diagnosed based on ophthalmologic findings, which include specialized visual testing. The testing involves dilated fundus examination to identify characteristic changes in the optic disc and vascular changes during the acute phase, electrophysiologic studies, and neuroimaging. Molecular genetic testing for mitochondrial genes associated with LHON can be used to confirm diagnosis. Most affected individuals know if their family members also are affected by LHON.","movement disorders, neurologic abnormalities, bilateral, painless subacute loss of central vision during young adult life, peripheral neuropathy, postural tremor, nonspecific myopathy, visual failure in the eye",SIGN
Ichthyosis-Netherton-Syndrome,"Netherton syndrome is a rare hereditary disorder characterized by scaling skin, hair anomalies, increased susceptibility to atopic eczema (a skin condition that can result in dry, red and flaky skin), elevated IgE levels, and other related symptoms. Netherton syndrome is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. Netherton syndrome is a rare hereditary disorder.

Erythromelalgia,"Erythromelalgia is a rare condition that primarily affects the feet and, less commonly, the hands (extremities). It is characterized by intense, burning pain of affected extremities, severe redness (erythema), and increased skin temperature that may be episodic or almost continuous in nature. (The prefix ""erythro-"" denotes redness, ""mel-"" is a combining form meaning limb or limbs, and the suffix ""-algia"" indicates pain.)

The disease course may be extremely variable from case to case.","increased skin temperature, erythema",SIGN
Restless-Legs-Syndrome,"Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a neurologic and sleep related movement disorder characterized by an irresistible urge to move in the legs that typically occurs or worsens at rest. It is usually accompanied by abnormal, uncomfortable sensations, known as paresthesias or dysesthesias, that are often likened to crawling, cramping, aching, burning, itching, or prickling deep within the affected areas. Although the legs are usually involved, an urge to move with paresthesias or dysesthesias may also sometimes affect the arms or other areas of the body. Those with RLS may vigorously move the affected area, engage in pacing, or perform other, often repetitive movements, such as stretching, bending, or rocking. Symptoms typically worsen in the evening or at night, often resulting in sleep disturbances. Some individuals with RLS may also develop symptoms during other extended periods of inactivity, such as while sitting in a movie theater or traveling in a car. RLS may occur as a primary condition or due to another underlying disorder, certain medications, or other factors (secondary or symptomatic RLS). In primary RLS, the disorder is often genetic in origin or occurs for unknown reasons (idiopathic). Secondary RLS may occur in association with certain conditions, such as iron deficiency, low levels of the oxygen-carrying component of red blood cells (anemia), kidney failure, or pregnancy. Restless legs syndrome appears to be about twice as common in women than men. Associated symptoms may become apparent at any age, and the disorder is usually chronic, often becoming more severe with increasing age. However, in some affected individuals, RLS symptoms may periodically subside and recur with varying levels of severity. According to some reports, although most individuals do not bring their symptoms to the attention of physicians until middle age, up to 40 percent may initially experience symptoms before age 20. The diagnosis of restless legs syndrome (RLS) is based upon a thorough clinical evaluation; a complete patient history, including current medications; family history; and specialized tests. In addition, a clinical assessment scale may be used to help evaluate severity of the disorder. Various laboratory studies may be conducted to help detect or rule out possible associated conditions, including tests to measure iron and ferritin levels in the blood to assess iron stores in the body. In addition, a neurological examination may be conducted if associated neurological abnormalities are suspected (e.g., peripheral neuropathy). In addition, some physicians may recommend specialized sleep studies to evaluate sleep disturbances and possible PLMS, but sleep studies are not needed to diagnose uncomplicated RLS.","crawling, stretching, vigorously move the affected area, itching, cramping, burning, prickling deep, repetitive movements, rocking, peripheral neuropathy, bending, engage in pacing",SIGN
Dandy-Walker-Malformation,"Dandy-Walker malformation (DWM) is a brain malformation that occurs during embryonic development of the cerebellum and 4th ventricle. The cerebellum is the area of the brain that helps coordinate movement, and is also involved with cognition and behavior. The 4th ventricle is a space around the cerebellum that channels fluid from inside to around the outside of the brain. DWM is characterized by underdevelopment (small size and abnormal position) of the middle part of the cerebellum known as the cerebellar vermis, cystic enlargement of the 4th ventricle and enlargement of the base of the skull (posterior fossa). DWM is sometimes (20-80%) associated with hydrocephalus, in which blockage of the normal flow of spinal fluid leads to excessive amounts of fluid accumulating in and around the brain. This leads to abnormally high pressure within the skull and swelling of the head, and can lead to neurological impairment. DWM results from defects in early embryonic development of the cerebellum and surrounding structures.  A few patients have chromosome abnormalities including deletion of chromosome 3q24.3 (the location of the first DWM genes, known as ZIC1 and ZIC4), 6p25 or 13q32.2-q33.2, or duplication of 9p.  In the remainder, it is probably due to other more complex genetic and perhaps environmental factors (teratogens) as the recurrence risk in siblings less than 5%.  A few examples of affected siblings with isolated Dandy-Walker malformation have been reported, suggesting autosomal recessive or X-linked inheritance, but most of these are probably CVH and not typical DWM.  In these families, the recurrence risk is higher, up to 25%.  DWM may also occur as part of a genetic syndrome that includes multiple birth defects, such as the PHACES syndrome of facial hemangioma, heart and sternal defects and DWM.  Many other syndromes and chromosome abnormalities have been reported with DWM, but most of these appear to have CVH rather than typical DWM. The frequency of Dandy Walker malformation in the US is approximately 1 per 25,000 -35,000 live births and affects more females than males. Dandy Walker malformation is diagnosed with the use of ultrasound, CT and MRI. Prenatal diagnosis of Dandy-Walker malformation is sometimes made by ultrasound or fetal MRI.","cystic enlargement of the 4th ventricle, swelling of the head, defects in early embryonic development of the cerebellum and surrounding structures, high pressure within the skull, excessive amounts of fluid accumulating in and around the brain, multiple birth defects, underdevelopment cerebellar vermis, neurological impairment, blockage of the normal flow of spinal fluid l, enlargement of the base of the skull, chromosome abnormalities",SIGN
X,"X-linked myopathy with excessive autophagy (XMEA) is an extremely rare genetic disorder characterized by muscle disease (myopathy). The disorder is fully expressed in males only and is characterized by slowly progressive muscle weakness, especially in the legs. Onset is usually during childhood often between 5-10 years of age. XMEA occurs due to mutations of an unidentified gene on the X chromosome. The disorder is inherited an X-linked recessive trait. A diagnosis of XMEA is made based upon a thorough clinical evaluation, a detailed patient history and surgical removal and microscopic evaluation (biopsy) of affected muscle tissue.","myopathy, in males slowly progressive muscle weakness",SIGN
Amelogenesis-Imperfecta,"Amelogenesis imperfecta (AI) refers to a group of rare, inherited disorders characterized by abnormal enamel formation. The term is typically restricted to those disorders of enamel development not associated with other abnormalities of the body. AI affects 1 of 14,000 to 16,000 children in the United States. Of this number, about 40% have the hypocalcified dominant type. The autosomal dominant and recessive forms of the disorder affect males and females in equal numbers. The X-linked dominant type of the disorder affects twice as many males as females. The X-linked recessive type affects only males. Diagnosis of AI is usually made by visual examination, family history and X-ray examination at the time teeth erupt. The dentist may use a simple hand instrument to distinguish the different types of AI. By one to two years of age, the diagnosis can be made.",abnormal enamel formation,SIGN
Froelich-Syndrome,"Froehlich syndrome, also known as adiposogenital dystrophy, is a constellation of endocrine abnormalities believed to result from damage to the hypothalamus, a part of the brain that links the nervous system to the endocrine system via the pituitary gland.  The hypothalamus regulates sleep cycles and body temperature and composition while stimulating the pituitary gland to release a variety of hormones that control growth, metabolism, and body development. Thus, numerous pituitary gland hormones could be indirectly disrupted by damage to the hypothalamus. Unlike similar diseases such as Prader-Willi syndrome, Froehlich syndrome is acquired, not inherited, and is associated with tumors of the hypothalamus area or their surgical treatment, causing increased appetite and depressed secretion of gonadotropin. This syndrome affects males more often than females. Froehlich syndrome is characterized by increased or excessive eating that leads to obesity, small testes, and a delay in the onset of puberty. It is also common for children with Froehlich syndrome to experience the delay in physical growth and the development of secondary sexual characteristics. In addition to delayed growth and puberty, children with this syndrome tend to be short in stature. As a result of tumor growth, some children with Froehlich syndrome may also develop intellectual difficulties, poor vision – due optic nerve damage-, somnolence, and diabetes insipidus –  known as Infundibulo-tuberal syndrome (Froehlich+somnolence+diabetes insipidus), lower than normal body temperature (hypothermia) and very delicate skin. Froehlich syndrome is a very rare condition that affects more males than females.","hypothermia, very delicate skin, obesity, delay in physical growth, depressed secretion of gonadotropin, optic nerve damage, delay in development of secondary sexual characteristics, delay in the onset of puberty, damage to the hypothalamus, intellectual difficulties, small testes, poor vision, somnolence, increased or excessive eating, diabetes insipidus",SIGN
Hyperprolinemia-Type-I,"Two types of hyperprolinemia are recognized by physicians and clinical researchers. Each represents an inherited inborn error of metabolism involving the amino acid, proline. Proline is abundant in nature and readily found in a variety of foods. Hyperprolinemia Type I is the result of proline oxidase deficiency and is characterized by an abnormally high proline blood level.  Levels of the amino acids hydroxyproline and glycine in the blood are also higher than normal.  Some clinicians believe that kidney abnormalities may be associated with HP-I, although this is disputed.  The signs and symptoms of HP-I, other than the high levels of amino acids in the blood and urine, are vague.  Often, this disorder is described as benign. Hyperprolinemia Type I is a very rare disorder that is present at birth.  It affects males and females in equal numbers. HP-I is recognized by elevated blood proline levels. (The normal level is approximately 450 units, but people with HP-1 may have levels of 1900 to 2000 units.. Often, the diagnosis is made by exclusion. After failure to arrive at a diagnosis by other means, a blood proline level is ordered. The result confirms the diagnosis.","high levels of amino acids in the blood, glycine in the blood are also high, high levels of amino acids in the urine, Hyperprolinemia Type I, abnormally high proline blood level, kidney abnormalities, elevated blood proline levels, hydroxyproline in the blood are also high, inherited inborn error of metabolism involving the amino acid, proline",SIGN
Tardive-Dyskinesia,"Tardive dyskinesia is characterized by involuntary and abnormal movements of the jaw, lips and tongue. Typical symptoms include facial grimacing, sticking out the tongue, sucking or fish-like movements of the mouth. In some cases, the arms and/or legs may also be affected by involuntary rapid, jerking movements (chorea), or slow, writhing movements (athetosis). Symptoms of tardive dystonia include slower, twisting movements of larger muscles of the neck and trunk as well as the face. Tardive dyskinesia is caused by long-term use of a class of drugs known as neuroleptics. Neuroleptic drugs are often prescribed for management of certain mental, neurological, or gastrointestinal disorders. Metoclopramide and prochlorperazine are drugs used for chronic gastrointestinal conditions that may cause tardive dyskinesia. Neuroleptic drugs block dopamine receptors in the brain. Dopamine is a neurotransmitter which is a chemical that helps brain cells to communicate. Although most cases occur after a person has taken these drugs for several years, some cases may occur with shorter use of neuroleptic drugs. Tardive dyskinesia affects individuals who have been taking neuroleptic drugs for a long period of time.

Antithrombin-Deficiency,"Antithrombin deficiency is a rare disorder that affects males and females in equal numbers. Type I antithrombin deficiency is the most common subtype and is thought to occur in about one in every 3,000 to 5,000 people in the United States and is not limited to any particular ethnic group. It is estimated that approximately 1 percent of people who have venous thrombosis and embolism have congenital antithrombin deficiency. The acquired form of antithrombin deficiency is more prevalent than the congenital form of the disorder. A low blood level of antithrombin suggests that the patient may have antithrombin deficiency. However, it is important to keep in mind that many conditions can lower antithrombin levels (acute clots, heparin therapy, liver or kidney disease, etc.) without the patient having inherited antithrombin deficiency. Repeat testing should be done at a time when the patient is not ill, is not on heparin and does not have related medical problems.","lower antithrombin levels, low blood level of antithrombin",SIGN
Congenital-Pulmonary-Lymphangiectasia,"Congenital pulmonary lymphangiectasia (CPL) is a rare developmental disorder that is present at birth (congenital). Affected infants have abnormally widened (dilated) lymphatic vessels within the lungs. The lymphatic system helps the immune system in protecting the body against infection and disease. It consists of a network of tubular channels (lymph vessels) that drain a thin watery fluid known as lymph from different areas of the body into the bloodstream. Lymph accumulates in the tiny spaces between tissue cells and contains proteins, fats, and certain white blood cells known as lymphocytes. According to some reports CPL occurs more often in males than females. However, the data is not conclusive and CPL may occur in males and females in equal numbers. The exact number of cases of CPL is unknown. In the past, the disorder was associated with high mortality in the newborn period. CPL was first described in the medical literature in 1856.",dilated lymphatic vessels within the lungs,SIGN
Hiccups-Chronic,"A hiccup is an involuntary spasmodic contraction of the muscle at the base of the lungs (diaphragm) followed by the rapid closure of the vocal cords. Usually, hiccups last for a few hours or, occasionally, a day or two. However, chronic hiccups are ones that continue for an extended period of time. Episodes that last for more than two days and less than a month are sometimes called persistent hiccups. On rare occasions, hiccups persist even longer than a month or recur frequently over an extended period of time. The longest recorded episode of these chronic hiccups lasted 60 years. Hiccups are unmistakable, and rarely taken for anything else.  They often start for no apparent reason, and usually go away on their own in a few minutes.  Of concern is the period of time required for an episode to run its course.   Hiccups that persist over a period of time may cause exhaustion and weight loss from lack of sleep and the interruption of normal eating patterns. Hiccups affect males more often than females.  Hiccups occur in practically every human being, but chronic hiccups are very rare. There are many disorders involving the autonomic nervous system which controls unconscious activities of the body such as breathing, sweating, heartbeat, hiccups, coughing, etc. The diagnosis of chronic hiccups may be obvious, but blood, imaging, and other laboratory studies may be used to determine the underlying cause.","weight loss, Hiccups, hiccups, interruption of normal eating patterns, lack of sleep, hiccup, persistent hiccups",SIGN
Mal-de-Debarquement,"The true cause behind MDD is still unknown.  MDD likely results from the body’s balance system inadequately processing and adapting to multiple sensory inputs (visual, vestibular, proprioceptive and cognitive) from the environment once the stimulus (trigger) has ended.  It is as yet undetermined as to the cause of the balance system’s inability to appropriately compensate and adapt. How or why this happens remains a mystery. The majority of people affected are adult females, although there have been reports of males having the diagnosis. Patients with migraine may have any increased susceptibility through unknown mechanisms. The diagnosis of MDD still remains mostly clinical. As such, the history is very important. Persistent “dizziness” after an ocean cruise, a sailing trip, a prolonged airplane flight or a cross-country road trip is highly suggestive of MDD. Vestibular function tests in patients with MDD have been normal or nonspecific in their abnormality. These tests are important in excluding other etiologies for the patient’s symptoms.","body’s balance system inadequately processing and adapting to multiple sensory inputs, balance system’s inability to appropriately compensate and adapt",SIGN
Sheehan-Syndrome,"Excessive blood loss during or after delivery of a baby may affect the function of the pituitary gland, leading to a form of maternal hypopituitarism known as Sheehan syndrome (SS). Such extensive bleeding may reduce the blood flow to the pituitary gland causing the pituitary cells to be damaged or die (necrosis). Thus, the production of the usual pituitary hormones will be reduced, perhaps by a significant amount. During pregnancy the pituitary gland will enlarge and may double in size. At this time the gland is especially vulnerable to a severe drop in blood pressure (sometimes called ""shock"") and excessive maternal bleeding may induce the ""shock"" and the damage to the cells of the gland. At that time the amount of hormones produced by the pituitary may be decreased giving rise to the symptoms associated with hypopituitarism. There appear to be two forms of the disorder; a chronic form and an acute form, depending on the amount of damage to the gland's cells. The acute form reflects considerable damage so that symptoms become apparent soon after delivery. In chronic cases, the volume of damage is much less and symptoms may not appear for months or years after delivery. Sheehan syndrome affects women with excessive blood loss and circulatory collapse following childbirth. The incidence of Sheehan syndrome is not known. In patients with severe hemorrhaging on delivery accompanied by long-lasting low blood pressure, treatment is started as soon as possible. Women believed to have the chronic form usually have blood drawn and the levels for several hormones are determined.","amount of hormones produced by the pituitary may be decreased, long-lasting low blood pressure, hypopituitarism, pituitary cells necrosis, production of the usual pituitary hormones will be reduced, pituitary cells to be damaged",SIGN
Guanidinoacetate-Methyltransferase-Deficiency,"The severity of GAMT varies from patient to patient. Global developmental delays affect all individuals with this disorder and may be the first sign, appearing before other symptoms.The majority of individuals with GAMT deficiency have intellectual disabilities, seizure disorders, muscle weakness, behavior disorders, and movement disorders. People with GAMT may have weak muscle tone and delayed development of motor skills such as sitting or walking. Severely affected patients may lose previously acquired skills such as the ability to support their head or to sit unsupported. The prevalence of GAMT deficiency has been estimated to be from 1 out of 2,640,000 to 1 out of 550,000 patients being diagnosed to a conflicting report of 1 out of 115,000 patients being diagnosed.  As of 2015, there have only been 110 individuals with GAMT deficiency diagnosed worldwide. GAMT deficiency patients are frequently misdiagnosed with cerebral palsy as infants and toddlers. Children are often misdiagnosed with autism or global developmental delays.","weak muscle tone, seizure, movement disorders, behavior disorders, Global developmental delays, delayed development of motor skills, muscle weakness, intellectual disabilities",SIGN
Peeling-Skin-Syndrome,"A good history and physical exam are often sufficient to make the diagnosis, although specialized tests including surgical removal and microscopic evaluation (biopsy) of affected tissue may be necessary at times. The continual shedding of large sheets of skin distinguishes peeling skin syndrome from Netherton syndrome and from other types of autosomal recessive congenital ichthyosis, such as congenital ichthyosiform erythroderma. The skin of so-called “collodion babies” peels off after a few weeks and does not return, in contrast to patients with peeling skin syndrome whose symptoms return time after time.","continual shedding of large sheets of skin, skin peels off after a few weeks and does not return",SIGN
Keratoconus,"Keratoconus is an eye (ocular) disorder characterized by progressive thinning and changes in the shape of the cornea. The cornea is the thin, clear outer layer of the eye and is normally dome-shaped. Slowly progressive thinning of the cornea causes a cone-shaped bulge to develop towards the center of the cornea in the areas of greatest thinning. Affected individuals develop blurry or distorted vision, sensitivity to light (photophobia), and additional vision problems. Keratoconus often begins at puberty and most often is seen in teenagers or young adults. The specific underlying cause is not fully understood and most likely the condition results from the interaction of multiple factors including genetic and environmental ones. One factor known to contribute to progression of keratoconus is eye rubbing.  In some cases, keratoconus may occur as part of a larger disorder. Keratoconus is treated with glasses or contact lenses early in the condition. A small number of individuals may require surgery.","photophobia, cone-shaped bulge to develop towards the center of the cornea in the areas of greatest thinning, Slowly progressive thinning of the cornea, progressive thinning and changes in the shape of the cornea, blurry or distorted vision, vision problems",SIGN
Opsoclonus,"The component features of OMS include repeated, random and rapid eye movements in both horizontal, vertical and diagonal directions (opsoclonus); unsteady gait or loss of ability to stand and walk (ataxia); brief, repeated, shock-like spasms of several muscles within the arms, legs (myoclonus), or tremor interfering with hand use. Behavioral and sleep disturbances, including extreme irritability, inconsolable crying, reduced and fragmented sleep (insomnia) and rage attacks are common. Difficulty articulating speech (dysarthria), sometimes with complete loss of speech and language may occur. Additional symptoms such as decreased muscle tone (hypotonia) and vomiting are common. The most common cause of OMS in young children is paraneoplastic. A small, often hidden tumor presumably provokes the immune system into attacking the nervous system, which may also control the tumor or even cause it to regress. Tumors are NOT in the brain, but are in other areas of the body, usually in chest or abdomen. In 50-80 percent of affected young children, a tumor of embryonic nerve cells (neuroblastoma or ganglioneuroblastoma) is responsible for the symptoms associated with OMS. In other affected individuals, the disorder has been designated ‘idiopathic’ or attributed to various mostly viral infections. However, the high rate of spontaneous tumor regression means that the tumor may be gone before it is looked for. In older children or teens, viral infections are the most frequent apparent cause of OMS. In adults, paraneoplastic etiology is more common, most due to lung or breast cancers. In contrast to paraneoplastic OMS in infants and young children, whose tumors are biologically inactive and often benign, the tumors in adults are commonly malignant, often disseminated. OMS is a rare disorder: 1 per million individuals worldwide. It usually affects infants and young children, although it is also known to affect adults. The peak age in children is about 18 months, with very few diagnosed before 1 year, and a long tail out to about 5 – 6 years. Occurrence of opsoclonus in infants under 6 months old is quite uncommon, and opsoclonus in that age group, when isolated, is usually from another cause. OMS occurs in only slightly more girls than boys. It occurs in about 3% of all children with neuroblastomas. The diagnosis is clinical; there is no diagnostic test yet, as the antigen remains unidentified. The presence of the ‘dancing eyes’, the shock-like muscle spasms, and the impairment of gait, especially if accompanied by irritability, are highly reliable indicators of this syndrome. To detect a tumor in children, either a CT scan with oral and IV contrast or MRI with gadolinium of the neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis need to be done. PET scanning is often done in adults with OMS looking for other occult tumors. In addition, a spinal tap to detect neuroinflammation is necessary. Besides routine tests for infection, recommended CSF studies include so-called “MS panel”, to include oligoclonal bands (with paired serum sample), looking for antibodies secreted by B cells in the CSF. Also, lymphocyte subset analysis (flow cytometry) using immunophenotyping reveals an increased frequency of CSF CD 19+ B cells, which is an invaluable biomarker of OMS disease activity. Autoantibodies in some children with OMS have been at detected in research laboratories, but commercial autoantibody testing is not cost-effective and best reserved for atypical cases.

Bladder-Exstrophy,"Bladder exstrophy-epispadias-cloacal exstrophy complex is a spectrum of anomalies involving the urinary tract, genital tract, musculoskeletal system and sometimes the intestinal tract. In classic bladder exstrophy, most anomalies are related to defects of the abdominal wall, bladder, genitalia, pelvic bones, rectum and anus. In normal development, the cloacal membrane temporarily separates the urogenital and anal structures and them breaks when tissue that will form abdominal muscles begins to grow in its place.   The bladder exstrophy-epispadias-cloacal exstrophy complex is caused by a developmental abnormality that occurs 4-5 weeks after conception in which the cloacal membrane is not replaced by tissue that will form the abdominal muscles.  The underlying cause of this error in development is not known. The birth prevalence of classic bladder exstrophy has been estimated to be between 1 in 10,000 and 1 in 50,000 livebirths.  Males are affected 2-3 times more often than females.  Isolated epispadias occurs in approximately 1 in 112,000 live male births and 1 in 400,000 live female births.  Cloacal exstrophy occurs in approximately 1 in 400,000 live births. Prenatal ultrasound examination of a fetus with the complex may reveal absence of bladder filling, low-set umbilical cord, separation of pubic bones, small genitals and an abdominal mass that increases in size as the pregnancy progresses.","separation of pubic bones, developmental abnormality, low-set umbilical cord, absence of bladder filling, cloacal membrane is not replaced by tissue that will form the abdominal muscles, small genitals, abdominal mass that increases in size as the pregnancy progresses",SIGN
Myopathy-Myofibrillar,"Myofibrillar myopathies are a group of rare genetic neuromuscular disorders that may be diagnosed in childhood but most often appear after 40 years of age. These conditions are highly variable but are characterized by a slowly progressive muscle weakness that can involve skeletal and smooth muscle. Skeletal muscle weakness can be present in the muscles close to the center of the body (proximal) as well as the distal muscles. A weakening of the heart muscle (cardiomyopathy) is common and may manifest as arrhythmia, conduction defects or congestive heart failure. The frequency of myofibrillar myopathies has not been estimated.  It is likely that these conditions are unrecognized and underdiagnosed. A diagnosis of myofibrillar myopathies is made based on clinical findings, electromyography, nerve conduction studies and muscle biopsy. Molecular genetic testing for the DES, CRYAB, MYOT, LDB3 and ZASP genes is available to confirm the diagnosis. Molecular genetic testing for the BAG3 gene is available on a research basis only.","slowly progressive muscle weakness skeletal, congestive heart failure, Skeletal muscle weakness, cardiomyopathy, slowly progressive muscle weakness smooth, arrhythmia, conduction defects",SIGN
Ameloblastoma,"Ameloblastoma is a rare disorder of the jaw involving abnormal tissue growth. The resulting tumors or cysts are usually not malignant (benign) but the tissue growth may be aggressive in the involved area. On occasion, tissue near the jaws, such as around the sinuses and eye sockets, may become involved as well. The tissues involved are most often those that give rise to the teeth so that ameloblastoma may cause facial distortion. Malignancy is uncommon as are metastases, but they do occur. The cause of ameloblastoma is not understood.  Causes may include injury to the mouth or jaw, infections of the teeth or gums, or inflammation of these same areas.  Infections by viruses or lack of protein or minerals in the persons diet are also suspected of causing the growth or development of these tumors.  In general, however, scientists do not understand the cause of cysts and tumors, nor the reasons why they can become malignant. Ameloblastoma is a rare disorder that affects males and females in equal numbers.  It affects persons of all ethnic backgrounds and of all age groups. Ameloblastoma can show up either in a regular x-ray or in an MRI imaging study.","facial distortion, tissue growth, tumors, cysts, abnormal tissue growth",SIGN
Cyclic-Vomiting-Syndrome,"Cyclic vomiting syndrome affects females somewhat more often than males (55:45). It most commonly occurs in children between the ages of three and seven, although it can begin at any age, from early infancy through to old age (73 is the oldest). Because it is not recognized or misdiagnoses as stomach flu, a correct diagnosis is often delayed for many years. Although CVS is found more often in children, it is being recognized with greater frequency in adults. The incidence of CVS is unknown, although it is not rare. Two studies in Scotland and Australia have suggested that as many as 2% of all Caucasian school-aged children suffer from CVS. However, researchers believe the disorder is underdiagnosed, making it difficult to estimate its true frequency in the general population. CVS was first described in the medical literature in 1806 in French, and 1882 in English. A diagnosis of cyclic vomiting syndrome may be suspected based upon a thorough clinical evaluation, a detailed patient history, and identification of characteristic findings. The diagnostic criteria are currently based upon the consensus criteria of the North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition and the Rome IV Committee. The determination of CVS can only be made after other causes of recurrent vomiting have been ruled out. There is no “test” to prove the presence of cyclic vomiting syndrome, although the presence of urine ketosis early in an episode may be helpful. A variety of tests of may be used to rule out other, more common, causes of recurrent nausea and vomiting, including an upper gastrointestinal radiograph.","recurrent vomiting, urine ketosis early in an episode, vomiting",SIGN
Acquired-Aplastic-Anemia,"Acquired aplastic anemia affects males and females in about equal numbers. Most cases affect older children, teenagers or young adults. The incidence of aplastic anemia in Europe and Israel is two new cases among 1 million people per year. The incidence rate is two or three times greater in Asia. The exact incidence rates exist for the United States is unknown although some sources say that approximately 500-1,000 new cases of aplastic anemia are diagnosed each year. A diagnosis of acquired aplastic anemia may be suspected when an otherwise healthy individual has low levels of all three blood cell types (pancytopenia). A diagnosis may be confirmed by a thorough clinical evaluation, a detailed patient history, and a variety of specialized tests, including a bone marrow biopsy. During this procedure, a small specimen of bone marrow tissue is surgically removed, usually from the hip or pelvis, and studied under a microscope. In acquired aplastic anemia this sample will show a dramatic reduction or complete lack of cells. Additional tests may be necessary to rule out other disorders such as leukemia and to determine if there is an inherited or genetic cause.","anemia, pancytopenia",SIGN
Polymorphous-Low,"Polymorphous low-grade adenocarcinoma (PLGA) is a rare tumor of the salivary glands that is limited, to a great extent, to the minor salivary glands and commonly, but not exclusively, localized in the palate of the mouth. The major salivary glands are the parotid glands (at the side of the face, below the ears), the sublingual glands (below the tongue), and the submandibular glands (below the lower jaw).  As the name suggests, each of the major salivary glands is of substantial size and visible to the naked eye. There are about 600 to 1,000 minor salivary glands that are microscopic in size. These minor salivary glands are found in the lining (mucosa) of the lips, tongue, and hard and soft palate, as well as inside the nose, cheeks, and sinuses. A lump or mass in the palate or near any of the salivary glands should be seen by a physician as soon as possible.  A lingering pain in the area of the salivary glands is a signal to see a physician.  A change in the size and/or shape of one of the salivary glands (asymmetry) may be a sufficient reason to see a doctor.  Unexplained bleeding in the mouth is also a symptom warranting attention, and any persistent numbness on any part of the face or a weakening of the muscles on one side of the face should be brought to the attention of a physician.  Early diagnosis and treatment are important. Why a normal cell becomes malignant is not yet fully understood. In most instances PLGA affects people in their middle age.  The median age at which patients are diagnosed is 57 years, with a range of from 22 to 71 years.  For reasons that are unknown, this disease affects slightly more women than men. The diagnosis of PLGA may be suspected on history and clinical examination, but can be confirmed only by biopsy of the affected tissue.","weakening of the muscles on one side of the face, Unexplained bleeding in the mouth, salivary glands asymmetry, lump or mass in the palate, persistent numbness on any part of the face, lump or mass near any of the salivary glands",SIGN
Chromosome-18-Monosomy-18p,"Chromosome 18, Monosomy 18p is a rare chromosomal disorder in which all or part of the short arm (p) of chromosome 18 is deleted (monosomic). The disorder is typically characterized by short stature, variable degrees of mental retardation, speech delays, malformations of the skull and facial (craniofacial) region, and/or additional physical abnormalities. Associated craniofacial defects may vary greatly in range and severity from case to case. However, such features commonly include an unusually small head (microcephaly); a broad, flat nose; a ""carp-shaped"" mouth; large, protruding ears; widely spaced eyes (ocular hypertelorism); and/or other abnormalities. Rarely (i.e., in about 10 percent of cases), Monosomy 18p may be associated with holoprosencephaly, a condition in which the forebrain (prosencephalon) fails to divide properly during embryonic development. Holoprosencephaly may result in varying degrees of mental retardation, other neurologic findings, and/or extremely variable midline facial defects, such as the presence of a single, central front tooth (maxillary incisor); closely spaced eyes (hypotelorism); an abnormal groove in the upper lip (cleft lip); incomplete closure of the roof of the mouth (cleft palate); and/or, in severe cases, absence of the nose and/or cyclopia. Cyclopia is characterized by fusion of the eye cavities (orbits) into a single cavity containing one eye. Chromosome 18, Monosomy 18p appears to affect females more frequently than males by a ratio of approximately three to two.  Reports indicate that the mean parental age is older than average for the mothers and fathers of children with Monosomy 18p (i.e., age 32 years and 38 years, respectively).

Wyburn,"The exact cause of Wyburn-Mason syndrome is unknown. It is considered a developmental abnormality characterized by arteriovenous malformations. No specific genetic abnormality or hereditary tendencies have been identified. The specific, underlying mechanism(s) that cause the vascular malformations in Wyburn-Mason syndrome are not known. However, they are thought to result from abnormalities of blood vessel development during embryonic or fetal growth. Wyburn-Mason syndrome is an extremely rare disorder that appears to affect males and females in equal numbers. The incidence or prevalence rates of Wyburn-Mason syndrome in the general population are unknown. A diagnosis of Wyburn-Mason syndrome may be made based upon a thorough clinical evaluation, a detailed patient history, and identification of characteristic findings, especially ocular findings. Imaging studies such as a computed tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be performed to detect potentially dangerous central nervous system (CNS) malformations. During CT scanning, a computer and x-rays are used to create a film showing cross-sectional images of certain tissue structures.

Grover_s-Disease,"Grover's disease is a rare, transient skin disorder that consists of small, firm, raised red lesions, most often on the skin of the chest and back. Diagnosis of this disorder becomes apparent under microscopic examination when the loss of the ""cement"" that holds the skin cells together is observed. Over time, as the skin loses the ""cement"", the cells separate (lysis). Small blisters containing a watery liquid are present. These blisters tend to group and have a swollen red border around them. Grover's disease is mainly seen in males older than forty or fifty. Its cause is unknown but it is thought to be related to trauma to sun damaged skin. The exact cause of Grover’s disease is not known.  It may be related to fragility of old sun-damaged skin.  Some doctors feel that this skin disorder may be related to heat and sweating.  There have been multiple cases of this disorder associated with such things as hot tubs, hot water bottles, electric blankets, steam baths and prolonged confinement to a bed.

Filariasis,"Filariasis is an infectious tropical disease caused by any one of several thread-like parasitic round worms. The two species of worms most often associated with this disease are Wuchereria bancrofti and Brugia malayi. The larval form of the parasite transmits the disease to humans by the bite of a mosquito. In the early stages of the infection, the patient characteristically complains of fever, chills, headaches and skin lesions. Any one of several antiparasitic agents may be effective in eliminating the worm. However, if the disease is left untreated, obstruction of the lymph flow will cause particular areas of the body especially the legs and external genitals, to swell profoundly. Symptoms are primarily a response to adult worms that cause inflammation. Chronic inflammation may progress to hardening of the lymphatic vessels (fibrosis) and obstruction of the lymph flow. Filariasis is a rare infectious tropical disorder caused by the round worm parasites (nematode) Wuchereria bancrofti or Brugia malayi.  Symptoms result primarily from inflammatory reactions to the adult worms.  Some people may also develop hypersensitivity reactions to the small larval parasites (microfilariae). Filariasis is common disease in tropical regions of the world.  The organism W. bancrofti is present throughout Africa, Asia, China, and South America. B. malayi is found in southern and southeast Asia.  Filariasis is extremely rare in North America and occurs only when these organisms are imported from tropical regions.  The infection is transmitted by several different types of tropical mosquitos which transfer the larval stage of the organism (microfilariae) from one host to another. Lymphatic filariasis affects about 120 million people worldwide.  Short-term travelers to areas where it is endemic are at low risk for this infection.  People who visit endemic areas for extended periods of time, and especially those who are in areas or situations in which they are intensely exposed to infected mosquitoes, can become infected.  Most infections seen in the U.S. are in immigrants from endemic countries, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).","Chronic inflammation, inflammation, skin lesions, fever, hypersensitivity reactions, obstruction of the lymph flow, lymphatic vessels fibrosis",SIGN
Stiff-Person-Syndrome,"Stiff-person syndrome (SPS) is a rare acquired neurological disorder characterized by progressive muscle stiffness (rigidity) and repeated episodes of painful muscle spasms. Muscular rigidity often fluctuates (i.e., grows worse and then improves) and usually occurs along with the muscle spasms. Spasms may occur randomly or be triggered by a variety of different events including a sudden noise or light physical contact. In most cases, other neurological signs or symptoms do not occur. The severity and progression of SPS varies from one person to another. If left untreated, SPS can potentially progress to cause difficulty walking and significantly impact a person's ability to perform routine, daily tasks. Although the exact cause of SPS is unknown, it is believed to be an autoimmune disorder and sometimes occurs along with other autoimmune disorders. A diagnosis of SPS is made based upon identification of characteristic symptoms, a detailed patient history, and a thorough clinical evaluation. Additional tests can be used to support a diagnosis and to rule out other conditions. Such tests include screening tests to detect the presence of antibodies against GAD-65, antibodies against amphiphysin (which are associated with paraneoplastic SPS) and an electromyography (EMG), a test that records electrical activity in skeletal (voluntary) muscles at rest and during muscle contraction. An EMG can demonstrate continuous muscle motor unit firing in stiff muscles, which is characteristic of SPS. High doses of diazepam will suppress the characteristic EMG results.","Muscular rigidity, antibodies against amphiphysin, stiff muscles, painful muscle spasms, antibodies against GAD-65, Spasms, muscle spasms, difficulty walking, rigidity",SIGN
Macroglossia,"Macroglossia is the abnormal enlargement of the tongue. In rare cases, macroglossia occurs as an isolated finding that is present at birth (congenital). In many cases, macroglossia may occur secondary to a primary disorder that may be either congenital (e.g., Down syndrome or Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome) or acquired (e.g., as a result of trauma or malignancy). Symptoms and physical findings associated with macroglossia may include noisy, high-pitched breathing (stridor), snoring, and/or feeding difficulties. In some cases, the tongue may protrude from the mouth. When inherited, macroglossia is transmitted as an autosomal dominant genetic trait. Macroglossia is a disorder characterized by a tongue that is large in proportion to other structures in the mouth.  In the congenital type of the disorder, protrusion of the tongue from the mouth may interfere with feeding of the infant.  Later, talking may be affected.  The large size of the tongue may also cause abnormal development of the jaw and teeth, resulting in misaligned or protruding teeth.  Ulceration and dying tissue on the tip of the tongue may be other symptoms of the disorder. Isolated autosomal dominant macroglossia is very rare, with about 50 cases reported in the medical literature.  The prevalence in other instances depends on the underlying disorder for which the macroglossia is secondary.  For example, macroglossia occurs in most cases of Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, and the prevalence of that syndrome is estimated at 1 in 17,000 births.

Ivemark-Syndrome,"Ivemark syndrome is a rare disorder that affects multiple organ systems of the body. It is characterized by the absence (asplenia) or underdevelopment (hypoplasia) of the spleen, malformations of the heart and the abnormal arrangement of the internal organs of the chest and abdomen. The symptoms of Ivemark syndrome can vary greatly depending upon the specific abnormalities present. Many infants have symptoms associated with abnormalities affecting the heart including bluish discoloration to the skin due to a lack of oxygen in the blood (cyanosis), heart murmurs, and signs of congestive heart failure. Ivemark syndrome often causes life-threatening complications during infancy. The exact cause of Ivemark syndrome is not known. According to the medical literature, Ivemark syndrome affects boys more often than girls. The exact incidence of Ivemark syndrome is unknown. The incidence of laterality disorders taken together is estimated to be 1 in 15,000 people in the general population.","congestive heart failure, heart murmurs, cyanosis, malformations of the heart, abnormal arrangement of the internal organs of the chest and abdomen, asplenia, hypoplasia of the spleen, bluish discoloration to the skin",SIGN
Anemia-Pernicious,"Pernicious anemia is a rare blood disorder characterized by the inability of the body to properly utilize vitamin B12, which is essential for the development of red blood cells. Most cases result from the lack of the gastric protein known as intrinsic factor, without which vitamin B12 cannot be absorbed. The diagnosis of pernicious anemia may be confirmed by a thorough clinical evaluation, including a detailed patient history and specialized laboratory tests. During a Schilling test, the intestines' ability to absorb vitamin B12 is measured. The vitamin is labeled with radioactive cobalt and is ingested by mouth. X-ray studies can then determine if the body is properly absorbing this vitamin.","lack of the intrinsic factor, B12 cannot be absorbed, inability of the body to properly utilize vitamin B12",SIGN
Spastic-Paraplegia-47,"AP-4-associated hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP) is a group of slowly-progressing neurodegenerative disorders that generally present with global developmental delay, moderate to severe intellectual disability, impaired/absent speech, microcephaly, seizures, and progressive motor symptoms. The conditions included in this group are SPG47, SPG50, SPG51 and SPG52 and all have similar symptoms. These conditions are inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern and are caused by mutations in genes that result in production of an abnormal adaptor protein complex 4. Since many of the initial clinical manifestations of SPG47 are nonspecific and may resemble other disorders characterized by spasticity, developmental delay / intellectual disability, and seizures, the diagnosis is often only made after further diagnostic testing. This may include a brain MRI showing characteristic features such as a thin corpus callosum, wide lateral ventricles and changes in the white matter. A definitive diagnosis is reached by genetic testing.","global developmental delay, paraplegia, abnormal adaptor protein complex 4, progressive motor symptoms, wide lateral ventricles and changes in the white matter, spasticity, moderate to severe intellectual disability, intellectual disability, microcephaly, thin corpus callosum, impaired/absent speech, seizures, developmental delay",SIGN
Ahumada,"Ahumada-Del Castillo is a rare endocrine disorder affecting adult females, which is characterized by impairment in the function of the pituitary and hypothalamus glands. Symptoms may include the production of breast milk (lactation) not associated with nursing and the absence of menstrual periods (amenorrhea) due to the lack of monthly ovulation (anovulation). The symptoms of Ahumada-Del Castillo syndrome include the abnormal production of breast milk (galactorrhea) without childbirth and nursing, and the lack of regular menstrual periods (amenorrhea).  Women with this disorder have breasts and nipples of normal size and appearance.  Secondary female sexual characteristics, such as hair distribution and voice, are also normal.  Since the ovaries do not produce eggs, affected females cannot become pregnant. The exact cause of Ahumada-Del Castillo syndrome is not known, although some research suggests that small tumors in the pituitary or hypothalamus glands may be responsible for some cases.  These tumors are frequently microscopic and extremely difficult to detect.  Rarer causes of Ahumada-Del Castillo syndrome may be associated with low levels of thyroid hormone (hypothyroidism), chronic use of drugs that inhibit dopamine (antagonistics) (e.g., chlorpromazine or thorazine), and discontinuation of oral contraceptives (birth control pills).  In all cases, an over-secretion of the milk-producing hormone prolactin (hyperprolactinemia) results in the symptoms of Ahumada-Del Castillo. Ahumada-Del Castillo affects only females. The symptoms usually begin during adulthood.","mpairment in the function of the hypothalamus glands, lactation, amenorrhea, anovulation, impairment in the function of the pituitary, small tumors in the hypothalamus glands, low levels of thyroid hormone, small tumors in the pituitary glands, hyperprolactinemia, galactorrhea",SIGN
Central-Core-Disease,"Central core disease (CCD) is a rare genetic neuromuscular disorder that is classified as a congenital myopathy, meaning that it is a muscle disorder (myopathy) that is present at birth (congenital). Affected infants have diminished muscle tone (hypotonia) resulting in abnormal ""floppiness"", muscle weakness, and a variety of skeletal abnormalities such as side-to-side curvature of the spine (scoliosis). Muscle weakness normally affects the proximal muscles, which are those muscles closest to the center of the body such as the muscles of the shoulder, pelvis and upper arms and legs. Affected infants may experience delays in acquiring motor milestones such as crawling or walking. Some individuals with CCD may be susceptible to developing malignant hyperthermia, a condition in which individuals develop adverse reactions to certain anesthetic drugs. CCD may be very mild or may cause serious complications. Most cases are inherited as autosomal dominant trait and associated with nonprogressive muscle disease and a favorable prognosis. Some cases are inherited as autosomal recessive traits and are more likely to be associated with severe complications.","floppiness, weakness proximal muscles, hypotonia, adverse reactions to certain anesthetic drugs, delays in acquiring motor milestones, muscle weakness, Muscle weakness, scoliosis",SIGN
Primary-Biliary-Cholangitis,"Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) is a chronic, or long lasting, progressive liver disorder that mostly affects women and usually appears during middle age. PBC leads to inflammation and scarring of the small bile ducts (the plumbing system of the liver which transports bile, the substance that helps digest fat). When PBC is very severe, it can lead to yellow discoloration of the skin (jaundice). If PBC is untreated, it can lead to cirrhosis, or scarring of the entire liver, which can lead to liver failure.   PBC is divided into four stages, with stage 1 being early disease, where this is no significant scarring, to stage 4, or which is defined by cirrhosis. Although the exact cause of PBC is unknown, it is thought that it is likely due to a combination of factors such as  autoimmune (when a person’s own immune system attacks their body), genetic, and environmental factors. PBC affects mostly women, but more men are now being diagnosed. The disorder usually becomes apparent during middle age, initially affecting most individuals between the ages of 45 to 65 years. However, the disorder has been diagnosed in females as young as 22 years of age and in females in their early 90s. It has been estimated that PBC is one of the most common autoimmune diseases, affecting nearly 1 in 1000 women over the age of 40.","scarring of the entire liver, scarring of the small bile ducts, cirrhosis, jaundice, liver failure, inflammation of the small bile ducts",SIGN
Immune-Thrombocytopenia,"Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is an autoimmune bleeding disorder characterized by abnormally low levels of blood cells called platelets, a situation which is referred to as thrombocytopenia. Platelets are specialized blood cells that help maintain the integrity of the walls of our blood vessels and help prevent and stop bleeding by accelerating clotting. A normal platelet count ranges from approximately 150,000 to 400,000 per microliter of blood depending on the laboratory. If someone has a platelet count lower than 100,000 per microliter of blood with no other reason for low platelets, that person might have ITP. There is currently no definitive laboratory test to diagnose ITP. Rather ITP is considered a diagnosis of exclusion (see below) meaning that other causes have been eliminated or are unlikely. What tests to do to exclude other causes is not well-established and can differ among patients and hematologists.","thrombocytopenia, platelets low levels of, low platelets, platelet count lower than 100,000 per microliter of blood",SIGN
Renal-Glycosuria,"Renal glycosuria, also known as renal glucosuria, is a rare condition in which the simple sugar glucose is eliminated (excreted) in the urine despite normal or low blood glucose levels. With normal kidney (renal) function, glucose is excreted in the urine only when there are abnormally elevated levels of glucose in the blood. However, in those with renal glycosuria, glucose is abnormally eliminated in the urine due to improper functioning of the renal tubules, which are primary components of the filtering units of the kidneys (nephrons). In most affected individuals, the condition causes no apparent symptoms (asymptomatic) or serious effects. When renal glycosuria occurs as an isolated finding with otherwise normal kidney function, the condition is thought to be inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. Renal glycosuria is a rare condition that appears to affect males and females in equal numbers.  Reported cases of the disorder include affected individuals in several multigenerational families (kindreds).  In most individuals with renal glycosuria, no associated symptoms are apparent (asymptomatic).  Less commonly, under certain conditions, such as during pregnancy or starvation, serious symptoms and findings may become apparent (e.g., dehydration, ketosis). Renal glycosuria is diagnosed based upon laboratory tests that confirm the presence of glucose in the urine in association with normal or low blood glucose levels. (Such testing is typically conducted after overnight fasting.)","glucose is abnormally eliminated in the urine, simple sugar glucose is eliminated (excreted) in the urine despite normal or low blood glucose levels, dehydration, presence of glucose in the urine in association with normal or low blood glucose levels, improper functioning of the renal tubules, ketosis",SIGN
Bloom-Syndrome,"Bloom syndrome is a rare genetic disorder characterized by short stature; increased skin sensitivity to ultraviolet rays from the sun (photosensitivity); multiple small dilated blood vessels (telangiectasia) over the nose and cheeks resembling a butterfly in shape; mild immune deficiency with increased susceptibility to infections; and most importantly, a markedly increased susceptibility to many types of cancer, especially leukemia, lymphoma and gastrointestinal tract tumors. Bloom syndrome is a prototype of a group of genetic conditions known as chromosome breakage syndromes. The genetic abnormality in Bloom syndrome causes problems with DNA repair, resulting in a high number of chromosome breaks and rearrangements. The abnormal DNA repair is responsible for the increased risk for cancer.","chromosome breaks and rearrangements, short stature, mild immune deficiency, telangiectasia over the nose and cheeks, abnormal DNA repair, photosensitivity, problems with DNA repair",SIGN

Emphysema-Congenital-Lobar,"Congenital lobar emphysema is a rare respiratory disorder in which air can enter the lungs but cannot escape, causing overinflation (hyperinflation) of the lobes of the lung. It is most often detected in newborns or young infants, but some cases do not become apparent until adulthood. This disorder may be severe enough to cause associated heart problems (15% of cases) or so mild as to never become apparent. Some cases of congenital lobar emphysema may be caused by autosomal dominant inheritance while others occur for no apparent reason (sporadic). About 50% of cases occur in the first four weeks after birth.  About 75% of cases are found in infants less than six months of age.  This disorder is more common among boys than among girls.","hyperinflation of the lobes of the lung, air can enter the lungs but cannot escape",SIGN
Hereditary-Hyperphosphatasia,"Hereditary hyperphosphatasia is a rare genetic bone disorder (osteopathy) that usually becomes apparent during infancy or early childhood. Affected individuals develop progressive skeletal malformations especially in the long bones of the arms and legs. Skeletal malformations in the legs may cause problems walking and may eventually result in short stature. Additional symptoms include pain, fractures of affected bones, and muscle weakness. Because the biochemical and radiographic findings of hereditary hyperphosphatasia are similar to those of Paget's disease (a focal skeletal disorder of adults characterized by abnormal bone turnover), the disorder is sometimes referred to as juvenile Paget's disease. However, despite these similarities, the two disorders are distinct. Hereditary hyperphosphatasia is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. Hereditary hyperphosphatasia affects males and females in equal numbers. Like all recessive disorders it is more common in countries where within-family marriage is practiced. More than 50 cases have been described since the disorder was first reported in the medical literature in 1956. A diagnosis of hereditary hyperphosphatasia is made based upon a thorough clinical evaluation, identification of characteristic symptoms and a variety of x-rays tests that reveal distinct radiographic findings. Affected individuals also have elevated levels of serum alkaline phosphatase and other biochemical markers of bone turnover, detectable through blood and urine tests.","problems walking, abnormal bone turnover, short stature, elevated levels of serum alkaline phosphatase, fractures of affected bones, Skeletal malformations in the legs, progressive skeletal malformations, muscle weakness",SIGN
Dentin-Dysplasia-Type-II,"A diagnosis of coronal dentin dysplasia is made based upon identification of characteristic symptoms, a detailed patient history, and a thorough clinical evaluation.

Giant-Axonal-Neuropathy,"Giant axonal neuropathy is a rare neuropathy that severely affects the peripheral as well as the central nervous system. The first symptoms appear in early childhood. This disorder is characterized by abnormalities in the peripheral and central nervous systems including low muscle tone (hypotonia), muscle weakness, decreased reflexes, impaired muscle coordination (ataxia), seizures and intellectual disability. Pale, tightly curled hair is frequently seen in those affected. Giant axonal neuropathy follows autosomal recessive genetic inheritance. Symptoms of giant axonal neuropathy occur in early childhood before the age of seven years. Both the central and peripheral nervous systems are affected. The central nervous system includes the brain and spinal cord and the peripheral nervous system spreads out from the brain and spinal cord to all other areas of the body. Characteristics include low muscle tone (hypotonia), muscle weakness, decreased reflexes, impaired muscle coordination (ataxia), seizures and intellectual disability. In contrast to purely peripheral neuropathies, the reflex of the toes known as Babinski’s sign is often positive, indicating involvement of central motor pathways. Most affected children have pale, tightly curled hair unlike their parent’s hair. Cranial nerves may also be affected leading to facial weakness, abnormal eyes and poor vision. An unusual leg posture is present in some affected children. Skeletal abnormalities such as scoliosis and foot deformities have been described and are thought to be a result of the nervous system dysfunction. Mental development is in most cases initially normal, but later in childhood degenerative mental changes (dementia) may occur as the disorder progresses. Giant axonal neuropathy is rapidly progressive, usually leading to dependence on a wheel chair by the second decade of life and death in the second or third decade. Giant axonal neuropathy is a rare disorder that presents in early childhood. This disorder affects equal numbers of males and females. The prevalence of giant axonal neuropathy and the frequency of carriers of one defective copy of the GAN gene is not known, but it is known that giant axonal neuropathy is a very rare disease. Diagnosis of giant axonal neuropathy is made by clinical findings and specialized tests including nerve conduction velocity, brain MRI and peripheral nerve biopsy. The hallmark finding on a peripheral nerve biopsy is the appearance of ""giant axons"" which are caused by the accumulation of neurofilaments. Molecular genetic testing for abnormalities in the GAN gene is available to confirm the diagnosis. Negative mutation screening of the region of the GAN gene which encodes the protein does not exclude the diagnosis of giant axonal neuropathy.","facial weakness, abnormal eyes, pale, tightly curled hair, foot deformities, decreased reflexes, Skeletal abnormalities, ataxia, Babinski’s sign is often positive, abnormalities in the peripheral and central nervous systems, poor vision, Pale, tightly curled hair, seizures, dementia, muscle weakness, intellectual disability, hypotonia, unusual leg posture, scoliosis, nervous system dysfunction",SIGN
Tongue-Hairy,"Hairy tongue is an uncommon, benign condition that is also known as black hairy tongue or lingua nigra. It is characterized by abnormal elongation and blackish or dark brownish discoloration or ""staining"" of the thread-like elevations (filiform papillae) that cover most of the tongue's surface (dorsum linguae). Such changes often begin at the back (posterior) region of the top of the tongue and extend toward the front (anterior) of the tongue's surface but never involve the undersurface. Hairy tongue is thought to result from failure of the normal “shedding” (desquamation) of the outermost layer of the filiform papillae, overgrowth of certain pigment-producing bacteria or fungi normally present in the mouth, and an abnormal accumulation of pigment residues, keratin, or other debris in the region.  (Keratin is a fibrous protein that is a primary component of the outermost layer of the skin, nails, and hair.)  Although the specific underlying cause of hairy tongue remains unknown, several potential predisposing factors have been implicated.  Such factors include treatment with certain antibiotic medications (e.g., tetracycline therapy, which may lead to overgrowth of certain fungi); the use of particular oral bismuth-containing medications; the use of mouthwashes; smoking; chewing tobacco; excessive alcohol consumption; and/or poor oral hygiene.  Hairy tongue is not infectious nor does it lead to oral cancer. In males or females with hairy tongue, the age of onset is variable.  Hairy tongue most commonly affects adults; however, it may sometimes occur during childhood or adolescence.  It is not an inherited disease. There are additional disorders and conditions that may result in abnormal color changes or other alterations of the tongue.  Such conditions and disorders are typically characterized by symptoms and physical findings that differ from those associated with hairy tongue.  (For further information, choose the specific condition name in question as your search term in the Rare Disease Database.) In individuals with suspected hairy tongue, receiving a thorough evaluation by physicians, dentists, and/or oral surgeons is important to exclude other underlying conditions and to confirm a diagnosis of hairy tongue. Recommended treatment measures typically include removing potential predisposing factors, such as stopping smoking, discontinuing antibiotic therapy if possible and receiving proper alternative treatments as necessary under a physician's direction, and/or other appropriate steps. In addition, affected individuals should speak with their dental specialists for guidance concerning appropriate measures to improve oral hygiene in their particular case. Such measures typically include using a soft-bristled toothbrush to regularly cleanse the tongue.","""blackish or dark brownish discoloration or """"staining"""" of the filiform papillae"", abnormal accumulation of pigment residues, keratin, or other debris in the region, overgrowth of certain pigment-producing bacteria or fungi normally present in the mouth, elongation of the filiform papillae, desquamation of the outermost layer of the filiform papillae",SIGN
Paroxysmal-Cold-Hemoglobinuria,"Autoimmune hemolytic anemias as a group are estimated to affect 1-3 people per 100,000 in the general population.  Both the syphilitic and non-syphilitic forms of chronic PCH are exceedingly rare.  The prevalence and incidence rates are unknown.   Anyone may acquire PCH, but it is more common among children than among adults. An individual with a viral infection is at higher risk of contracting the disorder. No known genetic, sex, or racial risk factors exist, although the disease has been reported in families. A diagnosis of PCH may be suspected in some individuals with anemia. In particular, the diagnosis should be suspected in any acutely ill child with hemoglobinuria. A diagnosis is made based upon a thorough clinical evaluation, a detailed patient history, identification of characteristic symptoms and a variety of specialized tests such as a direct antiglobulin test (Coombs) test, which is used to detect certain antibodies that act against red blood cells. A diagnosis of PCH is confirmed by the results of a Donath-Landsteiner test, which can distinguish PCH from other forms of hemolytic anemia. The test consists of incubating a sample of the patient’s serum with normal red blood cells (RBCs) in the cold for 30 minutes and then warming the mixture to body temperature (37C). Hemolysis of the RBCs in this ""bi-phasic"" test indicates a diagnosis of PCH.","anemia, hemoglobinuria, antibodies that act against red blood cells, Hemolysis of the RBCs, hemolytic anemia",SIGN
Locked-In-Syndrome,"Locked-in syndrome is a rare neurological disorder that affects males and females in equal numbers. Locked-in syndrome can affect individuals of all ages including children, but most often is seen in adults who are more at risk for brain stroke and bleeding. Because cases of locked-in syndrome may go unrecognized or misdiagnosed, it is difficult to determine the actual number of individuals who have had the disorder in the general population.","stroke, brain bleeding",SIGN
Ventricular-Septal-Defects,"Ventricular septal defects are heart defects that are present at birth (congenital). The normal heart has four chambers. The two upper chambers, known as atria, are separated from each other by a fibrous partition known as the atrial septum. The two lower chambers are known as ventricles and are separated from each other by the ventricular septum. Valves connect the atria (left and right) to their respective ventricles. The aorta, the main vessel of arterial circulation, carries blood from the left ventricle and away from the heart. The exact cause of VSDs is not known. These defects probably occur as the result of errors in the development of an embryo. During the early part of fetal development there is no wall (septum) to separate the left and right ventricles. As the fetus grows, so does a muscular wall that splits the lower chamber into two ventricles.  If the muscle does not form a solid wall, a hole remains and is what is called the ventricular septal defect. The why and how of these developmental errors is not fully understood. However, research suggests that they may occur as the result of the complex interaction of many factors, both genetic and environmental (multifactorial).",heart defects congenital,SIGN
Hypothalamic-Hamartoma,"Hypothalamic hamartomas (HH) are rare, tumor-like malformations that occur during fetal development and are present at birth. They are non-progressive lesions and do not expand, spread or metastasize to other locations. They grow in proportion to normal brain growth, and consequently their relative size to the rest of the brain is the same for the lifetime of the patient. There is tremendous diversity in the type and severity of symptoms from patient to patient. However, symptoms are apparent during childhood in the overwhelming majority of patients. Two clinical phenotypes of HH are recognized: 1) central precocious puberty and 2) epilepsy and related neurobehavioral symptoms. Hypothalamic hamartomas are relatively rare. Population-based research has shown that HH with epilepsy occurs in 1 of 200,000 children and adolescents. The prevalence of HH with only precocious puberty is unknown. At least for HH with epilepsy, males appear to have a slightly higher risk than females (approximately 1.3 to 1 ratio). HH occurs worldwide, without any obvious geographical concentration of cases. It is currently felt that all ethnic groups are at equal risk. There are no identified maternal risk factors or fetal exposures that increase the risk of HH. As malformations of the ventral (inferior) hypothalamus, hypothalamic hamartomas are rather distinct from other conditions. It is important to note that tumors that occur in the same region (such as craniopharyngiomas, astrocytomas, optic nerve gliomas, etc) usually do not cause gelastic seizures. These tumors can, however, be associated with endocrine dysfunction, which includes precocious puberty under rare circumstances.","central precocious puberty, epilepsy, tumor-like malformations during fetal development, non-progressive lesions, malformations of the ventral (inferior) hypothalamus, precocious pubert, gelastic seizures, neurobehavioral symptoms",SIGN
Conradi-Hunermann-Syndrome,"Conradi-Hünermann syndrome is a rare genetic disorder characterized by skeletal malformations, skin abnormalities, cataracts and short stature. The specific symptoms and severity of the disorder may vary greatly from one individual to another. Conradi-Hünermann syndrome is classified as a form of chondrodysplasia punctata, a group of disorders characterized by the formation of small, hardened spots of calcium on the ""growing portion"" or heads of the long bones (stippled epiphyses) or inside other areas of cartilage in the body. Conradi-Hünermann syndrome is commonly associated with disproportionate and assymetric shortening of long bones, particularly those of the upper arms (humeri) and the thigh bones (femora), curvature of the spine and mild to moderate growth deficiency, resulting in short stature. Many affected individuals also have a prominent forehead; unusually flattened midfacial regions (midfacial hypoplasia), with a low nasal bridge; loss of transparency of the lenses of the eyes (cataracts); sparse, coarse scalp hair; and/or abnormal thickening, dryness, and scaling of the skin. Conradi-Hünermann syndrome is inherited as an X-linked dominant trait that occurs almost exclusively in females.","midfacial hypoplasia, prominent forehead, low nasal bridge, sparse, coarse scalp hair, short stature, disproportionate and assymetric shortening of long bones, formation of small, hardened spots of calcium inside other areas of cartilage in the body, skeletal malformations, stippled epiphyses, thickening, dryness, and scaling of the skin, mild to moderate growth deficiency, disproportionate and assymetric curvature of the spine, skin abnormalities, cataracts",SIGN
Erythema-Multiforme,"Erythema multiforme (EM) is the name applied to a group of hypersensitivity disorders, affecting mostly children and young adults, and characterized by symmetric red, patchy lesions, primarily on the arms and legs. The cause is unknown, but EM frequently occurs in association with herpes simplex virus, suggesting an immunologic process initiated by the virus. In half of the cases, the triggering agents appear to be medications, including anticonvulsants, sulfonamides, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and other antibiotics. In addition, some cases appear to be associated with infectious organisms such as Mycoplasma pneumoniae and many viral agents. Erythema multiforme is a rare disorder that affects slightly more males than females.  It may begin at any age, but is most common in children and young adults. Usually, the diagnosis can be made on the basis of the size, shape, color and distribution of the target lesions.","lesions, symmetric red, patchy lesions, Erythema",SIGN
Phosphoglycerate-Kinase-Deficiency,"Phosphoglycerate kinase deficiency is a very rare disorder that is fully expressed in males only. However, females who carry a single copy of the disease gene (heterozygous carriers) may exhibit some symptoms associated with the disorder (i.e., hemolytic anemia). The disorder can be diagnosed at birth when enzymatic testing is done. More than 30 cases of PGK deficiency have been written up in the medical literature.

MELAS-Syndrome,"MELAS (Mitochondrial Encephalopathy, Lactic Acidosis, and Stroke-like episodes) syndrome is a rare disorder that begins in childhood, usually between two and fifteen years of age, and mostly affects the nervous system and muscles. The most common early symptoms are seizures, recurrent headaches, loss of appetite and recurrent vomiting. Stroke-like episodes with temporary muscle weakness on one side of the body (hemiparesis) may also occur and this can lead to altered consciousness, vision and hearing loss, loss of motor skills and intellectual disability. MELAS is caused by mutations in mitochondrial DNA and in one patient, this syndrome has been associated with mutations in a nuclear gene, POLG1. MELAS syndrome is a rare disorder that affects males and females in equal numbers. Although rare, MELAS syndrome is probably the most common type of mitochondrial myopathy caused by mutations in mtDNA. Some researchers believe that mitochondrial myopathies may go unrecognized and underdiagnosed in the general population, making it difficult to determine the true frequency of disorders like MELAS syndrome.","vision and hearing loss, vomiting, intellectual disability, hemiparesis, loss of motor skills, seizures, altered consciousness, Stroke-like episodes",SIGN
Mulibrey-Nanism,"Mulibrey nanism is an extremely rare autosomal recessive genetic disorder characterized by profound growth delays and distinctive abnormalities of the muscles, liver, brain, and eyes. The acronym MULIBREY stands for (MU)scle, (LI)ver, (BR)ain, and (EY)e.  Nanism is another word for dwarfism. A characteristic feature not included in the original acronym is the overgrowth of the fibrous sac that surrounds the heart restricting normal filling of the heart (constrictive pericarditis). Characteristic symptoms may include low birth weight, short stature, and severe progressive growth delays. Muscles are usually underdeveloped and lack normal tone (hypotonia). Some infants with this disorder may have an abnormally large liver (hepatomegaly). Infants typically have yellow discoloration in their eyes. Mulibrey nanism is an extremely rare disorder that affects males and females in equal numbers.   Approximately 110 patients have been reported worldwide with this condition.

Stomach-Cancer,"Stomach cancer is a general term for cancer affecting the stomach. Generally, it refers to cancer that arises from the cells lining the stomach. These cells, like all cancerous cells, exhibit abnormal and rapid growth. Early in the course of the disease there are usually no symptoms (asymptomatic). As the disease progresses, symptoms like indigestion, nausea, vomiting, and feeling full earlier than normal (early satiety) may develop. The cause of stomach cancer is multifactorial, which means that multiple factors that occur together are necessary for the cancer to develop. These factors can include genetic, immunologic, infectious, and environmental factors. Stomach cancer usually develops randomly for unknown reasons (sporadically), and there is usually no family history. There are about 28,000 people diagnosed with stomach cancer in the United States each year. It affects men more often than it does women, and about 75% of people are over the age of 50. Most people are diagnosed between 60-80 years of age. By some estimates, stomach cancer is the second most common cancer worldwide. Stomach cancer can affect people of all races and ethnic groups but occurs with greater frequency in individuals of African or Hispanic heritage and Native Americans. Worldwide, stomach cancer is more common in East Asia, Eastern Europe, and South America.","indigestion, vomiting",SIGN
Turcot-Syndrome,"Turcot syndrome is a rare inherited disorder characterized by the association of benign growths (adenomatous polyps) in the mucous lining of the gastrointestinal tract with tumors of the central nervous system. Symptoms associated with polyp formation may include diarrhea, bleeding from the end portion of the large intestine (rectum), fatigue, abdominal pain, and weight loss. Affected individuals may also experience neurological symptoms, depending upon the type, size and location of the associated brain tumor. Some researchers believe that Turcot syndrome is a variant of familial adenomatous polyposis. Others believe that it is a separate disorder. The exact cause of Turcot syndrome is not known. Turcot syndrome affects males and females in equal numbers.

Paget_s-Disease,"Paget’s disease is rarely diagnosed in people under the age of 40 years but may occur in up to eight percent of the population over the age of 60 years. Paget’s disease affects individuals of all ethnic and racial groups. However, it affects individuals of Asian descent less frequently. Both men and women are affected with a slight male predominance. The prevalence of Paget’s disease in the United States is estimated to be 1-2 percent of the general population. The diagnosis of Paget’s disease may be confirmed by a thorough clinical evaluation, detailed patient history, and a variety of specialized tests, such as blood tests, x-rays, and urine tests. A blood test may reveal elevated levels of the enzyme alkaline phosphatase suggesting the diagnosis of Paget’s disease. A bone scan or x-ray may also be used to determine abnormalities in the bones. Urine tests, such as pyrilinks and osteomark, may also be used to assist in the diagnosis of Paget’s disease.",elevated levels of the enzyme alkaline phosphatase,SIGN
Carpenter-Syndrome,"Carpenter syndrome belongs to a group of rare genetic disorders known as “acrocephalopolysyndactyly” (ACPS) disorders. All forms of ACPS are characterized by premature closure of the fibrous joints (cranial sutures) between certain bones of the skull (craniosynostosis), causing the top of the head to appear pointed (acrocephaly); webbing or fusion (syndactyly) of certain fingers or toes (digits); and/or more than the normal number of digits (polydactyly). Carpenter syndrome is also known as ACPS type II. Carpenter syndrome appears to affect males and females in relatively equal numbers. More than 70 cases of the disorder have been recorded. In 10 patients that had sequence analysis for the disease causing gene, homozygosity (two copies) for the same nonsense mutation, (a change in the DNA that causes a change in the protein) was found. This is indicative of a founder effect in patients of northern European descent, which means that a high prevalence of a genetic disorder in an isolated or inbred population is due to the fact that many members of the population are derived from a common ancestor who had the disease causing mutation.","craniosynostosis, acrocephaly, syndactyly, polydactyly",SIGN
Yellow-Nail-syndrome,"Yellow nail syndrome is an extremely rare disorder characterized by malformations affecting the fingernails and toenails, abnormalities affecting the lungs and the airways (respiratory tract), and swelling or puffiness in different parts of the body because of the accumulation of protein-rich fluid (lymph) in the soft layers of tissue under the skin (lymphedema). Yellow nail syndrome usually affects older adults. The exact cause of yellow nail syndrome is not known. Occasionally, yellow nail syndrome has been reported to run in families suggesting that genetic factors may play a role in the development of the disorder in some patients. A diagnosis of yellow nail syndrome is made based upon a thorough clinical evaluation, a detailed patient history and identification of characteristic findings. The nail changes in yellow nail syndrome are distinct from the nail changes that occur in most other lymphedema syndromes.","lymphedema, abnormalities affecting the lungs and the airways, malformations affecting the fingernails and toenails, nail changes",SIGN
Glanzmann-Thrombasthenia,"The symptoms of Glanzmann thrombasthenia usually begin at birth or shortly thereafter and include the tendency to bruise and bleed easily and sometimes profusely, especially after surgical procedures. Other symptoms may include susceptibility to easy bruising, nosebleeds (epistaxis), bleeding from the gums (gingival), intermittent gastrointestinal bleeding, and/or variably large red or purple colored spots on the skin that are caused by bleeding in the skin (purpura). Women with GT often also have unusually heavy menstrual bleeding, irregular uterine bleeding, and excess bleeding in childbirth. Rarely, internal bleeding and blood in the urine (hematuria) can occur. The severity of the symptoms varies greatly. Some affected individuals have mild bruising and others have severe hemorrhages that can be life threatening. Glanzmann thrombasthenia is a rare disorder that affects males and females in equal numbers. The symptoms of this disease are usually apparent at birth (neonates) or during infancy. Approximately 500 cases have been reported, but many cases have probably not been reported. This condition occurs with greater frequency in populations in which intermarriage within a group (consanguinity) is more prevalent such as in some regions of the Middle East, India, and France.","heavy menstrual bleeding, irregular uterine bleeding, bleeding from the gums, bleed, severe hemorrhages, purpura, mild bruising, intermittent gastrointestinal bleeding, bruise, bleeding, bruising, epistaxis, hematuria, internal bleeding",SIGN
IRF6,"VWS is the most common single gene cause of cleft lip and palate. The prevalence is in the range of 1/35,000-1/100,000 in Europe and Asia. The prevalence of PPS is approximately 1/300,000.",cleft lip and palate,SIGN
Autoimmune-Hepatitis,"Autoimmune hepatitis is a rare disorder that affects females 4 times as often as males. Type 1 is more common and is usually diagnosed in adults. Type 2 is more common in children and often involves a more severe disease process. There are also variant types of AIH; these include individuals with AIH and one of the other autoimmune liver diseases (primary sclerosing cholangitis or primary biliary cholangitis).Those with other autoimmune conditions have a 25-50% chance of developing another one and thus a higher risk for developing AIH. The new cases per year (incidence) are estimated at 1-2 per 100,000 and total cases (prevalence) are approximately 24 per 100,000. Studies suggest that the incidence of AIH is increasing and the reason is unknown.",hepatitis,SIGN
Progressive-Symmetric-Erythrokeratodermia,"Progressive symmetric erythrokeratoderma (PSEK) represents a group of rare genetic skin disorders characterized by well-demarcated plaques of reddened, dry, and thickened skin. Typically, these lesions are distributed symmetrically on the body and tend to slowly expand and progress over time. The severity and progression of the disorder can vary greatly from one person to another, even among members of the same family. In some families, PSEK can be part of the clinical spectrum of other rare skin disorders, such as erythrokeratodermia variabilis or loricrin keratoderma. In the majority, the molecular cause of PSEKis not known. The symptoms of PSEK usually develop shortly after birth or during the first year of life. Infants develop reddened plaques of thickened, rough and/or scaly skin, especially on the face, buttocks, arms and legs. Over time, these lesions can cover large areas of the body. The distribution of these lesions is almost perfectly symmetrical, meaning the size, shape and location of the lesions are extremely similar on both sides of the body. These plaques are slowly progressive increasing in number and size throughout early childhood before either stabilizing or disappearing sometime later during life. Rarely, waxing and waning may occur. In some cases, the chest and abdomen may become involved. Abnormally thickened or calloused skin on the palms and soles (palmoplantar keratoderma) is not uncommon. PSEK affects males and females in equal numbers. The prevalence of the disorder in the general population is unknown. The disorder was first described by Darier in 1911. Since then, fewer than 100 cases have been described in the medical literature. A diagnosis of PSEK is made based upon identification of characteristic symptoms, a detailed patient history, a thorough clinical evaluation and specialized tests including genetic testing or surgical removal (biopsy) and microscopic evaluation of affected tissue.","lesions symmetrically, reddened plaques of thickened, rough and/or scaly skin, palmoplantar keratoderma, lesions, waning, plaques, waxing, well-demarcated plaques of reddened, dry, and thickened skin, lesions symmetrical",SIGN
Meningitis-Bacterial,"Bacterial Meningitis is a central nervous system disease caused by certain types of bacteria. Meningitis is characterized by inflammation of the membranes (meninges) around the brain or spinal cord. Inflammation can begin suddenly (acute) or develop gradually (subacute). Major symptoms may include fever, headache, and a stiff neck, sometimes with aching muscles. Nausea, vomiting and other symptoms may occur. In the United States, approximately 2,600 sporadic cases of Bacterial Meningitis are reported each year.  Meningitis caused by pneumococcal infections affects about 1.1 in 100,000 individuals.  Meningitis caused by haemophilus influenza affects about .2 in 100,000 individuals.  About 70 percent of all Bacterial Meningitis occurs in children aged 5 and under.  Children under age 2 are at highest risk for infection, and males are affected more often than females.  Bacterial Meningitis in general occurs most often during the first month of a newborn’s life and is usually caused by gram-negative bacteria such as Escherichia coli or by group B streptococcus.  Bacterial Meningitis caused by Hemophilus influenzae type B occurs most often in infants over 1 month old and young children.  However, in the United States, this type of Bacterial Meningitis occurs more often in adults as a result of a vaccine that has led to a decline in the number of affected infants and children.   Bacterial Meningitis caused by pneumococcus bacteria occurs most often in adults, but there are an estimated 1,400 cases of pneumococcal meningitis each year among children under age five. Testing for Bacterial Meningitis may include imaging techniques such as CT scans or MR imaging. Other testing may include examination of the patient's blood and/or skin. Diagnosis is made by examination of the cerebrospinal fluid.","vomiting, meningitis, Meningitis, fever, inflammation of the membranes (meninges) around the brain or spinal cord, Inflammation, stiff neck",SIGN
Progressive-Osseous-Heteroplasia,"The diagnosis of progressive osseous heteroplasia may be confirmed by a thorough clinical evaluation, characteristic physical findings, and tests that demonstrate the presence of heterotopic ossification (e.g., x-ray and roentgenograms) with characteristic appearance for POH. An additional test may include the removal and testing of tissues (biopsy). In some cases, there may be temporarily (transient) increased levels of alkaline phosphatase in the blood serum.","transient increased levels of alkaline phosphatase in the blood serum, heterotopic ossification",SIGN
Kniest-Dysplasia,"Kniest dysplasia is one of several forms of dwarfism that is caused by a change (mutation) in a gene known as COL2A1. This gene is involved in the production of a particular protein that forms type 2 collagen, which is essential for the normal development of bones and other connective tissue. Changes in the composition of type 2 collagen lead to abnormal skeletal growth and, thus, to a variety of dwarfing conditions known as skeletal dysplasias. Kniest Syndrome is a rare disorder that affects males and females in equal numbers. Newborns with this disorder are clearly in distress so that x-rays may be ordered. Diagnosis may frequently be made on the basis of the radiographs developed, while a bone biopsy usually clarifies more ambiguous cases.","Changes in the composition of type 2 collagen, abnormal skeletal growth",SIGN
Fetal-Retinoid-Syndrome,"Fetal retinoid syndrome is a pattern of mental and physical birth defects (congenital malformations) that can result from a mother taking retinoids during pregnancy. The absolute risk of congenital malformations following oral isotretinoin therapy is currently unclear. Overall malformation rates in live-born infants from prospectively reported pregnancies range from 5% to 20%. Fetal retinoid syndrome affects males and females in equal numbers. The exact incidence of fetal retinoid syndrome is unknown and because many children with fetal retinoid syndrome often go unrecognized. The disorder is under-diagnosed, making it difficult to determine the true frequency of the disorder in the general population.",congenital malformations,SIGN
Nemaline-Myopathy,"Nemaline myopathy is a rare disorder that affects males and females. The incidence is unknown although two studies (one in Finland and one in an American Ashkenazi Jewish population) estimated the incidence to be 1 in 50,000 live births. An incidence of 1/500 has been reported in the Amish community. A diagnosis of nemaline myopathy is suspected based upon a thorough clinical evaluation, a detailed patient and family history and identification of characteristic findings. A diagnosis of nemaline myopathy is suspected based upon a thorough clinical evaluation, a detailed patient and family history and identification of characteristic findings. A diagnosis may be confirmed by the presence of thread- or rod-like structures (nemaline bodies) on muscle biopsy when stained with Gomori trichrome. A biopsy is the surgical removal and microscopic evaluation of affected tissue. Increasingly the diagnosis is made or confirmed by molecular genetic testing for mutations in the genes known to cause nemaline myopathy.",nemaline bodies,SIGN
Kluver,"Major symptoms may include excessive oral tendencies with an urge to put all kinds of objects into the mouth, hypermetamorophosis (a need to explore everything), memory loss, emotional changes, extreme sexual behavior, indifference, placidity, visual distractibility and visual agnosia (difficulty identifying and processing visual information). An almost uncontrollable appetite for food may also be noted. There may also be other symptoms associated with dementia (loss of reason) as well. Klüver-Bucy syndrome is the result of damage to the temporal lobes of the brain. This may be the result of trauma to the brain itself, or the result of other degenerative brain diseases, tumors, or it can be caused by some brain infections, most commonly herpes simplex encephalitis (a viral brain infection). Klüver-Bucy syndrome is a very rare disease that affects males and females equally. Treatment of Klüver-Bucy syndrome is supportive and psychotropics that may be effective for some of the associated symptoms.","visual agnosia, excessive oral tendencies with an urge to put all kinds of objects into the mouth, visual distractibility, hypermetamorophosis, placidity, damage to the temporal lobes of the brain, extreme sexual behavior, indifference, emotional changes, dementia, memory loss",SIGN
Lennox,"Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) is a severe form of epilepsy that typically becomes apparent during infancy or early childhood. Affected children experience several different types of seizures most commonly atonic, tonic and atypical absence seizures. Children with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome may also develop cognitive dysfunction, delays in reaching developmental milestones and behavioral problems. Lennox-Gastaut syndrome can be caused by a variety of underlying conditions, but in some cases no cause can be identified. Lennox-Gastaut syndrome can be difficult to treat because it is resistant (refractory) to many kinds of antiseizure medications. Research is ongoing to identify and assess new therapies for Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Lennox-Gastaut syndrome affects males slightly more often than females. Lennox-Gastaut syndrome is estimated to occur in .1-.28 people per 100,000 and is believed to account for 1-4 percent of all cases of childhood epilepsy. The annual incidence in children is estimated to be 2 per 100,000 children. Onset of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome is usually between 2-7 years with a peak onset between 3 to 5 years.","delays in reaching developmental milestones, behavioral problems, atonic, tonic and atypical absence seizures, seizures, cognitive dysfunction, epilepsy during infancy or early childhood",SIGN
Keratosis-Seborrheic,"Seborrheic Keratosis is a skin disorder usually characterized by discolored lesions that appear to be ""stuck on"" the skin surface. Warts may appear and skin is often oily or greasy. These skin lesions are sometimes mistaken for cancerous growths and tend to appear predominately during middle age. Itching, irritation, inflammations or unsightliness of lesions may require surgical removal of affected skin areas. Symptoms of Seborrheic Keratosis are limited to discolored skin lesions that appear to be “stuck on” the skin surface.  These patches may appear suddenly, may vary in size, and tend to grow slowly.  They may be round or oval-shaped, and vary in color from tan, yellowish-brown to black.  They may be widespread over the trunk, back, and/or shoulders.  Some may be large enough to be called “giants” while others may be limited to small areas of the temples or cheeks.  The skin lesions may also be waxy, scaling or crusted.  They tend to become darker and larger with age. The exact cause of Seborrheic Keratosis is not known although researchers believe some forms may be inherited as a dominant trait.  Human traits including the classic genetic diseases, are the product of the interaction of two genes for that condition, one received from the father and one from the mother.  In dominant disorders, a single copy of the disease gene (received from either the mother or father) will be expressed “dominating” the normal gene and resulting in appearance of the disease.  The risk of transmitting the disorder from affected parent to offspring is 50% for each pregnancy regardless of the sex of the resulting child.) Seborrheic Keratosis predominately affects middle aged individuals, although in very rare cases, it can be present at birth. Since Seborrheic Keratosis is not a form of skin cancer, treatment is not essential and removal of lesions is usually performed only to enhance comfort and/or cosmetic appearance. Treatment of Seborrheic Keratosis consists of removal of the skin lesions by scraping (curettage), sealing off blood vessels or destruction of lesions (electrodessication) with local anesthetic, shave excision, or freezing with CO2 snow or liquid nitrogen. Trichloroacetic acid may be used to eliminate lesions. Dermabrasion removal may also be performed. In most cases, scarring is not associated with removal of these skin lesions.","skin lesions, lesions, skin oily or greasy, inflammations, unsightliness of lesions, discolored lesions, irritation, Warts, Itching, patches, discolored skin lesions",SIGN
Fournier-Gangrene,"Fournier gangrene is an acute necrotic infection of the scrotum; penis; or perineum. It is characterized by scrotum pain and redness with rapid progression to gangrene and sloughing of tissue. Fournier gangrene is usually secondary to perirectal or periurethral infections associated with local trauma, operative procedures, or urinary tract disease. The mean age of presentation is about 50 years, but the range of patient ages in reported cases is from eight days to 90 years. Fournier gangrene is diagnosed more frequently among males. It may be that the high male to female ratio in the diagnosis is the result of the lack of recognition of this entity among women by physicians. It is believed that the male to female proportion may be anywhere from 5:1 to 10:1.","gangrene, acute necrotic infection of the perineum, acute necrotic infection of the penis, acute necrotic infection of the scrotum, scrotum redness",SIGN
Congenital-Fiber-Type-Disproportion,"Congenital fiber type disproportion (CFTD) is a rare genetic muscle disease that is usually apparent at birth (congenital myopathy). It belongs to a group of muscle conditions called the congenital myopathies that tend to affect people in a similar pattern. Major symptoms may include loss of muscle tone (hypotonia) and generalized muscle weakness. Delays in motor development are common and people with more marked muscle weakness also have abnormal side-to-side curvature of the spine (scoliosis), dislocated hips, and the permanent fixation of certain joints in a flexed position (contractures), particularly at the ankle. CFTD affects males and females in equal numbers. The incidence of the disorder in the general population is unknown but it is uncommon. The disorder is usually present at birth (congenital) but may not be recognized for many months. Case reports describing children with the features of CFTD first appeared in the medical literature in the 1960s and 70s. The term congenital fiber type disproportion was first used in 1973.","contractures, Delays in motor development, contractures at the ankle, hypotonia, generalized muscle weakness, muscle weakness, dislocated hips, scoliosis",SIGN
Cutis-Marmorata-Telangiectatica-Congenita,"The exact cause of CMTC is not known. Most cases occur randomly, for no apparent reason (spontaneously). Researchers believe that the disease results from genetic mosaicism. One theory suggests that abnormal pericyte recruitment can cause skin capillaries to contract inappropriately. In a few rare cases, it has appeared that CMTC may occasionally run in families (familial cases). CMTC affects males and females in equal numbers and is present at birth (congenital). Fewer than 300 cases of CMTC have been reported in the medical literature. Since many cases of CMTC are mild and clear up without treatment, the disorder may be under-diagnosed making it difficult to determine the true frequency of CMTC in the general population. The diagnosis of CMTC may be confirmed by a thorough clinical evaluation, a detailed patient history, and identification of characteristic findings.","skin capillaries to contract inappropriately, abnormal pericyte recruitment",SIGN
Sutton-Disease-II,"Sutton disease II is characterized by the recurring eruption of painful inflamed ulcers in the mouth (stomatitis). There may be multiple ulcers of varying sizes. These ulcers in the mouth are commonly called canker sores. Sutton disease II is also known as recurrent aphthous stomatitis. The exact cause of this disease is not fully understood, although it may be due to an abnormal immune response to the bacteria that are normally in the mouth. The exact cause of Sutton disease II is not known.  Several studies suggest that it may occur because of an abnormal immune response to the bacteria that are normally present in the mouth.  Deficiencies of iron, vitamin B12, and folic acid seem to increase an individual’s susceptibility to this disease. Stress and local injury may also be involved.  There seems to be no relationship between Sutton disease II and menstruation, pregnancy, and/or menopause, nor is it caused by herpes virus, which is the main cause of common canker sores. Sutton disease II affects more adult females than males.  However, before puberty, males and females are equally affected.  This disease occurs most frequently in malnourished children or adults whose immune systems are suppressed (i.e., by chemotherapy) or compromised (i.e., acquired immune deficiency syndrome).","stomatitis, canker sores, multiple ulcers of varying sizes, ulcers in the mouth",SIGN
Bernard,"The symptoms of Bernard-Soulier syndrome, which are typically apparent at birth and continue throughout life, may include the tendency to bleed excessively from cuts and other injuries, nosebleeds (epistaxis), and/or an unusually heavy menstrual flow in women. Some babies and children with BSS have no symptoms and the disorder does not present until adult life. People with this disease also bruise easily and the bruises tend to linger. Bleeding from very small blood vessels under the skin (subcutaneous) may cause small or widespread areas of small red or purple colored spots (purpura or petechiae). Bernard-Soulier syndrome is a rare bleeding disorder that affects males and females in equal numbers. Recent estimates suggest that Bernard Soulier syndrome affects 1 in a million people. More than 200 cases have been reported worldwide. The diagnosis of Bernard-Soulier syndrome is made by a combination of blood testing to reveal whether platelets are at abnormally low levels (thrombocytopenia), microscopic examination to determine the presence of abnormally large platelets and irregularly shaped platelets, and a test called ‘flow cytometry, which is able to measure the level of expression of the missing protein ion the outside of platelets affected by Bernard-Soulier syndrome. In recent years, most families are offered molecular genetic testing to identify which gene carries the mutations.","thrombocytopenia, heavy menstrual flow in women, bruises, petechiae, large platelets, purpura, bleed excessively from cuts and other injuries, bruise, Bleeding, epistaxis, irregularly shaped platelets",SIGN
Liposarcoma,"The specific cause of liposarcoma is still unknown. Clinically, it can be first noticed particularly in the extremity in an area of recent trauma where the patient may find a mass, however the cause and effect are quite likely purely coincidental. Liposarcoma generally is attributed to a change in some of the genes that are normally present in fat cells.  A series of abnormalities in these genes (mutations or DNA alterations) can lead to malignant changes characterized by uncontrollable growth. Liposarcoma is a soft tissue sarcoma, affecting approximately 2000 individuals each year in the United States. It affects men more than women, and more specifically middle-aged men ranging from 50 – 65 years of age. Children are rarely diagnosed, but when liposarcoma does occur in children, it is usually during adolescence. There is no specific ethnicity in which liposarcoma is more common. Certain risk factors have been shown to predispose individuals to developing soft tissue sarcomas, such as liposarcoma, including: prior radiation, familial cancer syndromes, damage to the lymph system, and long term exposure to certain toxic chemicals such as vinyl chloride, a chemical used to make plastic. There are other diseases that can present very similarly to liposarcoma. Lipoma is a non-cancerous (benign) tumor that can look similar to liposarcoma but it is usually softer and feels like a mass directly below the skin rather than in deeper parts of the body. A lipoma cannot transform into a liposarcoma. Other soft tissue tumors, such as undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma, lipomatous hemangiopericytoma, non-lipogenic sarcoma and gastrointestinal stromal tumors, can also look similar to liposarcoma when initially evaluated under a microscope.",mass directly below the skin,SIGN
Pyruvate-Dehydrogenase-Complex-Deficiency,"Common symptoms of PDCD may initially be poor feeding, lethargy and rapid breathing (tachypnea) in an infant. Neurologic symptoms are progressive and usually start in infancy but may even be apparent at birth. These symptoms can include motor delay, poor muscle tone, seizures, incoordination (ataxia), abnormal eye movements and poor visual tracking. Infants with the prenatal onset form may demonstrate brain malformations on neuroimaging. Individuals with the early childhood-onset form of PDCD may have normal neurologic development with intermittent periods of ataxia, often associated with upper respiratory infection or other minor stress. Varying degrees of neurologic deficits and mental retardation may occur in individuals with PDCD. Several hundred cases of PDCD have been reported. More males than females have severe disease and early death and progressive neurological symptoms are observed more often in females, although some females have severe symptoms. Biochemical abnormalities may vary from severe acidosis (due to abnormally high levels of lactic acid) appearing shortly after birth to a mildly elevated level which usually follows a meal high in carbohydrates. In some cases elevation of blood lactate levels is seen only during the acute episodes. Excretion of abnormally large amounts of the amino acid alanine (alaninuria) may occur only during acute episodes. Imaging studies such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) may reveal structural brain abnormalities associated with severe disease. A definitive diagnosis can be made by demonstrating abnormal PDC enzyme levels or function in leukocytes, fibroblasts or from a tissue biopsy.","ataxia, tachypnea in an infant, motor delay, poor visual tracking, alaninuria during acute episodes, neurologic deficits, Biochemical abnormalities, severe acidosis, mental retardation, poor muscle tone, seizures, upper respiratory infection, abnormal eye movements",SIGN
Mayer,"Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser (MRKH) syndrome is a rare disorder that affects women. It is characterized by the failure of the uterus and the vagina to develop properly in women who have normal ovarian function and normal external genitalia. Women with this disorder develop normal secondary sexual characteristics during puberty (e.g., breast development and pubic hair), but do not have a menstrual cycle (primary amenorrhea). Often, the failure to begin the menstrual cycle is the initial clinical sign of MRKH syndrome. The range and severity of MRKH syndrome can vary greatly and the disorder is generally broken down into type I, which occurs as an isolated finding, and type II, which occurs with abnormalities of additional organ systems including mainly the kidneys and the skeleton. Because of the nature of the disorder, MRKH syndrome can cause significant psychological challenges and counseling is recommended. The exact cause of MRKH syndrome remains largely unknown, but there is now no doubt of a genetic origin. In this respect, an update on the most recent research publications shows the involvement of several chromosomal segments, some of them including genes likely to account for the disorder.","primary amenorrhea, failure to begin the menstrual cycle, failure of the uterus and the vagina to develop properly in women",SIGN
Acquired-Neuromyotonia,"Acquired neuromyotonia is an autoimmune disease in which the immune system malfunctions so that it damages parts of one’s own body. Approximately 40% of affected individuals have antibodies to voltage-gated potassium channels (VGKC’s) that affect the points at which the signals from the nerve fiber meet the muscle cell (neuromuscular junction). Aquired neuromyotonia is a rare disorder affecting males and females but is slightly more common among men. Disease onset is usually between the ages of 15 and 60 years but has also been reported in childhood. The diagnosis of acquired neuromyotonia is based on the presence of continuous muscle contractions (myokymia), especially in the face and hands, rhythmic tics or twitches (fasciculations), and muscle cramps. The diagnosis is confirmed by studies of the electrical signs of muscle activity (electromyography).","fasciculations, muscle cramps, myokymia",SIGN
