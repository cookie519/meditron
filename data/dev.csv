0,Primary-Lateral-Sclerosis,"Primary lateral sclerosis (PLS) is a rare, neuromuscular disorder that affects the central motor neurons and is characterized by painless but progressive weakness and stiffness of the muscles of the legs. Such weakness may progress to affect the arms and the muscles at the base of the brain (bulbar muscles). Less frequently, the muscles of the face are affected. In most cases, the disorder affects adults during midlife. The exact cause of primary lateral sclerosis is unknown. The exact cause of primary lateral sclerosis is not known. Most cases seem to occur randomly, for no apparent reason (sporadically). Primary lateral sclerosis is one of a group of disorders known as motor neuron diseases. Motor neuron diseases are characterized by malfunction of the nerve cells (motor neurons) within the brain and spinal cord that carry instructions from the brain to the muscles. Primary lateral sclerosis is a rare disorder that affects males and females in equal numbers. In most cases, the disorder occurs during the fifth decade. However, according to the medical literature a familial form may exist that affects children. The exact prevalence of primary lateral sclerosis and motor neuron diseases is unknown. Treatment of primary lateral sclerosis involves the use of drugs to help control specific symptoms. Baclofen and tizanidine may be prescribed for spasticity, quinine for cramps, and diazepam, a drug that relaxes muscles, for muscular contractions. Additional treatments may include physical therapy to prevent stiffness of joints, and speech therapy may be needed to aid affected individuals whose ability to speak has been impaired by muscle weakness. Other treatment is symptomatic and supportive.","primary lateral sclerosis, Primary lateral sclerosis, PLS","neuromuscular disorder, Motor neuron diseases, motor neuron diseases",,"weakness bulbar muscles, ability to speak impaired, progressive weakness of the muscles of the legs, spasticity, weakness arms, stiffness of joints, stiffness of the muscles of the legs, malfunction of the motor neurons, cramps, muscle weakness, muscular contractions, weakness muscles of the face"
1,Alkaptonuria,"Alkaptonuria is a rare genetic metabolic disorder characterized by the accumulation of homogentisic acid in the body. Affected individuals lack enough functional levels of an enzyme required to breakdown homogentisic acid. Affected individuals may have dark urine or urine that turns black when exposed to air. However, this change may not occur for several hours after urination and often goes unnoticed. Aside from dark urine that is present from infancy, affected individuals generally do not develop symptoms (asymptomatic) during infancy or childhood and often remain unaware of their condition until adulthood. Affected individuals eventually develop ochronosis, which is the bluish-black discoloration of connective and other tissue within the body. Affected individuals may develop discoloration of the skin overlying cartilage within the body such as over part of the outer ear. In some cases, the whites of the eyes (sclera) may also become discolored. In adulthood, affected individuals also develop progressive arthritis of the spine and large joints. The HGD gene codes for the enzyme required for the breakdown of homogentisic acid. Mutations in the HGD gene cause alkaptonuria. Alkaptonuria affects males and females in equal numbers, although symptoms tend to develop sooner and become more severe in males. More than 1,000 affected individuals have been reported in the medical literature. The exact incidence of alkaptonuria is unknown. In the United States it is estimated to occur in 1 in 250,000-1,000,000 live births. Alkaptonuria has been reported in all ethnic groups.

2,Pediatric-Crohns-Disease,"Crohn’s disease is a common disorder, affecting as many as 780,000 people in the United States. The disorder is most common in individuals between 15-35, with approximately 25% diagnosed by age 20. There is another increase in frequency among individuals between 60-80 years of age. The frequency of pediatric Crohn’s disease is increasing; in particular, there has been a recent increase in the incidence of Crohn’s disease in children less than 6 years old; this is called very early onset (VEO) inflammatory bowel disease. Although more women are affected by Crohn’s disease than men, pediatric Crohn’s disease is more common in boys than girls. Pediatric Crohn’s disease is more common in Caucasians than in people of African descent. It is rare in people of Asian and Hispanic descent. Generally, Crohn’s disease is more severe among children and adolescents than in adults.","Crohn’s disease i, Pediatric Crohn’s disease, Crohn’s disease, pediatric Crohn’s disease, very early onset (VEO) inflammatory bowel disease",,,Crohn’s disease in children less than 6 years old
3,Lichen-Sclerosus,"Lichen sclerosus is a chronic inflammatory skin disorder that most commonly affects women before puberty or after menopause. Although rare, it can also be seen in men. When found in males, the disease is known as balanitis xerotica obliterans. Lichen sclerosus affects mostly females, usually between the ages of 40 and 60 years. Females are six times as likely to be affected as are males. Younger females and males have also been identified in the medical literature in the United States. Female children under the age of thirteen have also been reported with the condition. Lichen sclerosus is diagnosed by looking at the skin affected. All those affected require a thorough clinical evaluation, identification of characteristic physical features, and a detailed patient history. There should be focus on the functional impact of the lichen sclerosus and treatment to date, including over the counter products that might be applied. In order to be sure of the diagnosis, a skin biopsy may be needed. Biopsies may also be performed if squamous cell carcinoma is suspected.",,chronic inflammatory skin disorder,,
4,Enterobiasis,"Enterobiasis or pinworm infection is a common, contagious, parasitic infestation found mainly in children.

5,Meningitis-Tuberculous,"Tuberculous Meningitis (TBM) is a form of meningitis characterized by inflammation of the membranes (meninges) around the brain or spinal cord and caused by a specific bacterium known as Mycobacterium tuberculosis. In TBM, the disorder develops gradually. Treatment with antibiotics and other drugs is usually effective against the infection. Tuberculous Meningitis is a rare complication that occurs in some patients who have or have had tuberculosis (TB), especially miliary tuberculosis.  It can also occur in people who have been exposed to the bacteria that causes TB.  This form of meningitis is caused by a specific bacteria known as Mycobacterium Tuberculosis.  (For more information on tuberculosis, choose “tuberculosis” as your search term in the Rare Disease Database). TBM is usually found in children aged one to five years although it may occur at any age. Meningitis is usually treated with antibiotic drugs used against the bacteria causing the infection. These may include isoniazid, rifampin, streptomycin, and ethambutol. Treatment should last for at least 9 months to one year. Corticosteroid drugs such as prednisone may also be of benefit.","Tuberculosis, TBM, TB, Tuberculous Meningitis, tuberculosis, miliary tuberculosis","meningitis, Meningitis",,meninges inflammation of the
6,Very-Long-Chain-Acyl-CoA-Dehydrogenase-Deficiency-(LCAD),"Very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (VLCADD) is a rare genetic disorder of fatty acid metabolism that is transmitted as an autosomal recessive trait. It occurs when an enzyme needed to break down certain very long-chain fatty acids is missing or not working properly. VLCADD is one of the metabolic diseases known as fatty acid oxidation (FOD) diseases. In the past, the name long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (LCADD) was applied to one such disease, but today it is clear that all cases once thought to be LCADD are actually VLCADD. VLCADD was originally described in 1992 and is now recognized as having an incidence of 1:40,000 babies. The introduction of heel-stick tandem mass spectrometry for the early diagnosis of VLCAD in newborns has markedly increased the number of infants in which the disorder is detected.","VLCAD, LCADD, long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency, Very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency, VLCADD","genetic disorder of fatty acid metabolism, metabolic diseases, fatty acid oxidation (FOD) diseases",,enzyme needed to break down certain very long-chain fatty acids is missing or not working properly
7,CADASIL,"CADASIL is a rare genetic disorder affecting the small blood vessels in the brain. The term CADASIL was first coined in 1993. The age of onset, severity, specific symptoms and disease progression varies greatly from one person to another, even among members of the same family. CADASIL is an acronym that stands for: CADASIL affects males and females in equal numbers. The disorder is found worldwide and affects all races. The disease affects approximately 2 to 5 of 100,000 people. Research suggests that the disorder often goes undiagnosed or misdiagnosed making it difficult to determine the true frequency of CADASIL in the general population.",CADASIL,genetic disorder,,
8,Hartnup-Disease,"SLC6A19 Hartnup disease affects both males and females in equal numbers. The disorder usually begins in childhood and continues into adulthood.

9,Soft-Tissue-Sarcoma,"Soft tissue sarcomas affect men and women and individuals of any age and every racial and ethnic group. This is a large group of tumors, but overall, they are still classified as rare disorders. Estimates to their frequency varies. The American Cancer Society estimates that soft tissue sarcomas account for about 2% of all cancers in the United States.

10,Anemia-Hereditary-Nonspherocytic-Hemolytic,"Hereditary nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia is a term used to describe a group of rare, genetically transmitted blood disorders characterized by the premature destruction of red blood cells (erythrocytes or RBCs). If the red blood cells cannot be replaced faster than they destroy themselves, anemia is the result. Hereditary nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia is a rare blood disorder that affects more males than females.

11,Alveolar-Soft-Part-Sarcoma,"Alveolar soft part sarcoma (ASPS) is a rare, slow growing soft tissue tumor of an unclear cause. 
It is among the least common sarcomas, representing 0.2-1 percent of large studies of soft tissue sarcomas. ASPS is characterized by a painless mass that most commonly arises in the leg or buttock, with a particular affinity to travel to the lungs as multiple nodules, presumably while the sarcoma itself is still small. This disorder is very rare because it involves a specific breaking and joining event between two chromosomes, called an “unbalanced translocation”. This finding is observed in essentially all people with ASPS examined so far. This finding cannot be passed on to children, however, as the finding occurs only in the tumor cells, not in the normal cells. In addition, there are no families in which multiple family members have the disorder. ASPS tends to occur more often in younger individuals, specifically adolescents and young adults. ASPS tends to affect younger people, especially those between 15 and 35 years of age. It is rare in children under 5 or in adults over 50. Women outnumber men, especially under age 25. There appears to be no link of this tumor to a particular ethnicity. ASPS accounts for about 0.2-1% of all soft tissue sarcomas. In turn, soft tissue sarcomas account for approximately 1% of all cancers.","ASPS, Alveolar soft part sarcoma","sarcomas, soft tissue sarcomas, slow growing soft tissue tumor, sarcoma, cancers",,"painless mass in the leg, painless mass in the buttock, unbalanced translocation"
12,Multifocal-Motor-Neuropathy,"Multifocal motor neuropathy is a rare disorder characterized by slowly progressive muscle weakness, primarily of the arms and legs. The disorder is considered to be immune-mediated, which means there is inflammation resulting from abnormal functioning of the immune system and the presence of specific autoantibodies that target a specific protein in the body. Other symptoms including muscles cramps and wasting (atrophy) of muscles can also occur. The term multifocal means arising from two or more spots. The term motor refers to the motor nerves, which are those that carry nerve impulses from the brain to the muscles. The exact, underlying cause of this disorder is not fully understood. The disorder is acquired at some point during a person’s life; a person is not born with the disorder. Multifocal motor neuropathy usually responds to treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin. Multifocal motor neuropathy affects both men and women, although men are more frequently affected than women by a ratio of about 2.7:1. Men also tend to be diagnosed at a younger age. The median age of onset is 40 years old, although the disorder has been reported individuals ranging from 20-80 years of age. In a handful of instances, the disorder has occurred in children (pediatric cases). Multifocal motor neuropathy is estimated to affect about 0.6 per 100,000 in the general population. Because rare disorders often go undiagnosed or misdiagnosed, determining their true frequency in the general population is difficult.",Multifocal motor neuropathy,,,"muscles cramps, abnormal functioning of the immune system, inflammation, slowly progressive muscle weakness, atrophy of muscles, presence of specific autoantibodies that target a specific protein in the body, of the arms slowly progressive muscle weakness, of the g slowly progressive muscle weakness"
13,Trichothiodystrophy,"TTD is present at birth. Males and females are affected in equal numbers. The estimated incidence is about 1 in 1,000,000 newborns in the United States and Europe. Over 100 patients have been reported worldwide. TTD has been reported in all ethnic groups. An initial evaluation for TTD involves a diagnostic work-up, including obtaining a detailed history of the patient’s prenatal and neonatal history. A detailed physical exam is performed to assess clinical features such as hair abnormalities, short stature, small chin, ichthyosis, intellectual impairment or developmental delay, and bone and teeth anomalies. Evaluation by a developmental pediatrician or neurologist may determine whether there is any developmental delay or intellectual impairment. MRI imaging of the brain to identify abnormal patterns of myelination is often performed. Laboratory testing for immune function, blood count and iron levels can also be performed. TTD is typically diagnosed by polarized light microscopy of hair shafts, revealing a tiger-tail pattern, and at times by measurement of reduced sulfur content in patient’s hair. The classical tiger-tail pattern alone usually is enough to diagnose TTD. However, there are other conditions with similar hair shaft abnormalities and often genetic testing is ordered to confirm the diagnosis. However, there are a few patients with features of TTD who will not have mutations in the known genes. They may have mutations in yet to be identified TTD associated genes.",,intellectual impairment,,"abnormal patterns of myelination, hair abnormalities, bone and teeth anomalies, developmental delay, short stature, ichthyosis, intellectual impairment, small chin, reduced sulfur content in patient’s hair, tiger-tail pattern hair shafts, hair shaft abnormalities"
14,C3-Glomerulopathy_-Dense-Deposit-Disease-and-C3-Glomerulonephritis,"Over the past decade, important advances in our understanding of complement-mediated renal diseases have led to the adoption of new names or ‘disease categories’ to more precisely group diseases that appear to share a similar cause. Consider, for example, dense deposit disease (DDD), a very rare kidney disease characterized on a renal biopsy test called ‘immunofluorescence’ by an abundance of a protein called C3 in the renal glomeruli, and named for the extremely dense ‘sausage-like’ deposits that are seen in the glomerular basement membrane (GBM) using electron microscopy. In 2013, as a result of a consensus meeting, scientists recommended that DDD be sub-grouped under a new heading – C3 Glomerulopathy, abbreviated C3G. The adoption of this new term was driven by the recognition that there is another group of patients with glomerular disease whose kidney biopsy is reminiscent of DDD. On electron microscopy, the deposits in these patients are lighter in color and more widespread in location, but on immunofluorescence, as with DDD there is an abundance of C3 in the renal glomeruli. These patients are said to have C3 glomerulonephritis or C3GN.  In recognition of shared similarities, both DDD and C3GN are now classified as sub-types of C3G. C3G affects persons of all ages, although the mean age appears to be lower in DDD patients as compared to C3GN patients. The prevalence of C3G is estimated at 2-3 per 1,000,000 people. C3G can ONLY be diagnosed by a kidney biopsy. The kidney deposits stain for the complement protein C3 and when examined under an electron microscope, dense deposits are present.","C3GN, C3 glomerulonephritis, C3G, glomerular disease, DDD, C3 Glomerulopathy, dense deposit disease",kidney disease,,"kidney deposits, abundance of C3 in the renal glomeruli, abundance of a protein called C3 in the renal glomeruli, dense ‘sausage-like’ deposits in the glomerular basement membrane"

However, many cases of these disorders may go undiagnosed or misdiagnosed, making it difficult to determine the true frequency of Gitelman syndrome in the general population. The prevalence of individuals with one mutated copy of a gene (known as heterozygotes or carriers of the disease) is approximately 1% of European populations. These heterozygotes may enjoy a benefit of a small degree of salt wasting: they have lower blood pressures than the general population.",Gitelman syndrome,,,lower blood pressures
17,Pseudo-Hurler-Polydystrophy,"Pseudo-Hurler polydystrophy (mucolipidosis type III) is a rare genetic metabolic disorder characterized by a defective enzyme known as UPD-N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphotransferase. This defective enzyme ultimately results in the accumulation of certain complex carbohydrates (mucopolysaccharides) and fatty substances (mucolipids) in various tissues of the body. The symptoms of this disorder are similar, but less severe than those of I-cell disease (mucolipidosis type II) and may include progressive joint stiffness, curvature of the spine (scoliosis), and/or skeletal deformities of the hands (e.g., claw-hands). Growth delays accompanied by deterioration of the hip joints typically develop in children with pseudo-Hurler polydystrophy. Additional symptoms may include clouding of the corneas of the eyes, mild to moderate coarseness of facial features, mild mental retardation, easy fatigability, and/or heart disease. Pseudo-Hurler polydystrophy is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. A diagnosis of pseudo-Hurler polydystrophy may be suspected based upon a thorough clinical evaluation, a detailed patient history and identification of characteristic findings. A variety of specialized tests may confirm a diagnosis. These tests include detecting elevated lysosomal enzyme activity in serum or decreased enzyme levels in white blood cells or cultured connective tissue cells (fibroblasts).","pseudo-Hurler polydystrophy, Pseudo-Hurler polydystrophy, mucolipidosis type III, mucolipidosis type II, I-cell disease","heart disease, scoliosis, mental retardation, genetic metabolic disorder",,"accumulation of mucopolysaccharides and mucolipids, heart disease, elevated lysosomal enzyme activity in serum, Growth delays, mild to moderate coarseness of facial features, easy fatigability, defective UPD-N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphotransferase, clouding of the corneas of the eyes, decreased enzyme levels in white blood cells, progressive joint stiffness, claw-hands, skeletal deformities of the hands, mild mental retardation, deterioration of the hip joints, decreased enzyme levels in fibroblasts, scoliosis"

19,Arteriovenous-Malformation,"Arteriovenous malformation (AVM) is a vascular lesion that is a tangle of vessels of varying sizes in which there is one or more direct connections between the arterial and venous circulations. In the lesion there is no capillary bed, which is part of normal tissue. Brain AVMs are often presumed to be congenital, but there is no direct evidence that they form in utero. The distribution of age at detection for brain AVMs is normally-distributed with the mean age in the mid-30’s. Although a small number of AVMs manifest themselves at or shortly after birth, most of them present later in life, and just as likely, form and progress during the later years of life. The lack of capillaries allows blood traveling through the abnormal fistulous connections to flow rapidly. The low resistance of the direct A-V connections, termed fistulas, results in very high flow rates in the vessels leading to and within the AVM. These high flow rates can lower the pressure in the arteries leading to the AVM and to surrounding relatively normal brain tissue. Further, because of the direct A-V connections, the pressure in the arteries, even if somewhat reduced, are transmitted to the veins draining the AVM and surrounding brain, which normally operate at very low pressures. AVM can occur in many different parts of the body, but those located in the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord) can cause problems that affect the brain like other forms of stroke. AVM are often attributed to result from an error in embryonic or fetal development, but there is no direct evidence of this assertion. No environmental risk factors have been identified for neurological AVM. AVM does not usually run in families, but somewhere on the order of 5% of AVMs may be due to autosomal dominant inheritance of a genetic mutation, most commonly hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia or the capillary malformation-AVM syndrome. AVM can rarely be associated with certain syndromes such as Wyburn-Mason syndrome. AVM affects males and females in equal numbers. There does not appear to be an increased risk for particular ethnic and racial groups. The best estimates for new detection of an AVM are 1 per 100,000 population per year (about 3000 new cases detected per year in the U.S.) The population prevalence is about 10 per 100,000, i.e., there are probably about 30,000 individuals in the U.S. who harbor an AVM or have had an AVM that was treated. They occur throughout life, but the peak onset of symptoms is 35-40 years of age.","AVM, Arteriovenous malformation, AVMs",stroke,,"vascular lesion, lower the pressure in the arteries, fistulas, lesion, lack of capillaries, direct A-V connections, stroke, blood traveling through the abnormal fistulous connections to flow rapidly, high flow rates, low resistance of the direct A-V connections, high flow rates in the vessels"

22,Chromosome-6-Partial-Trisomy-6q,"Chromosome 6, Partial Trisomy 6q is an extremely rare chromosomal disorder in which a portion of the 6th chromosome (6q) is present three times (trisomy) rather than twice in cells of the body. Associated symptoms and findings may vary in range and severity from case to case. However, many affected infants and children have slow physical development (growth retardation); mental retardation; malformations of the skull and facial (craniofacial) region; an unusually short, webbed neck; abnormal bending (flexion) or extension of certain joints in fixed postures (joint contractures); and/or other physical abnormalities. In most cases, Chromosome 6, Partial Trisomy 6q has been the result of a balanced translocation in one of the parents. Chromosome 6, Partial Trisomy 6q is an extremely rare chromosomal disorder that appears to affect males and females equally.  Approximately 30 cases have been reported in the medical literature. Additional chromosomal disorders may have features similar to those potentially associated with Chromosome 6, Partial Trisomy 6q.

In the case of Banti syndrome, the spleen rapidly but prematurely destroys blood cells. Banti syndrome may occur due to a number of different factors causing obstruction of, and abnormally increased blood pressure (hypertension) within, certain veins of the spleen (splenic veins) or the liver (e.g., hepatic or portal veins).  These may include abnormalities present at birth (congenital) of such veins, blood clots, or various underlying disorders causing inflammation and obstruction of veins (vascular obstruction) of the liver, such as cirrhosis.  Increased arsenic intake has also been implicated in some cases.  Also, cases have occurred in patients taking long-term azathioprine, particularly after kidney transplantation. Banti syndrome affects males and females equally.  It is relatively common in parts of India and Japan, but rare in Western countries.  Increased arsenic levels are present in drinking water in some countries and may contribute to regional differences in incidence. The diagnosis of Banti syndrome my be confirmed by a thorough clinical evaluation and a variety of specialized tests, particularly advanced imaging techniques such as a splenic venography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

30,Alpers-Disease,"Alpers disease is a progressive neurologic disorder that begins during childhood and is complicated in many instances by serious liver disease. Symptoms include increased muscle tone with exaggerated reflexes (spasticity), seizures, and loss of cognitive ability (dementia). Alpers disease usually begins during early childhood, usually indicated by seizures at any age between 3 months and 5 years.  It is characterized by lack of coordination of motor movement, partial paralysis, seizures, and muscle twitching. The child is unable to achieve normal muscle tone (hypotonia), yet the limbs appear to be stiff. On MRI examination an increased density of the grey matter in the brain is noted. Usually, but not always, Alpers disease is associated with liver damage.  Mental retardation may be severe and is progressive.  The loss of intellectual functions such as thinking, remembering, and reasoning may also interfere with a person’s daily functioning (dementia).   In later stages, patients may lose control of the movement of their arms and legs (spastic quadriplegia). The liver may become cirrhotic and fail completely, or may not progress beyond signs of jaundice. Affected individuals may also become blind as a result of optic atrophy as the optic nerve degenerates. It is thought that Alpers disease affects males and females in equal numbers usually during early childhood.

32,Laband-Syndrome,"Laband syndrome, also known as Zimmerman-Laband syndrome, is an extremely rare genetic disorder characterized by abnormalities of the head and facial (craniofacial) area and the hands and feet. Most children with this disorder have abnormally large gums (gingival fibromatosis). Overgrown gums may affect the ability to chew, swallow, and/or speak. In addition, affected infants may exhibit abnormally long, thin fingers and toes and/or deformed (dysplastic) or absent nails at birth. In some cases, mental retardation may also be present. In most cases, Laband syndrome is believed to be inherited as an autosomal dominant trait. However, evidence of autosomal recessive inheritance has also been reported. In most cases, Laband syndrome may be diagnosed during early childhood. The diagnosis may be confirmed based upon a thorough clinical evaluation, a detailed patient history, and a variety of specialized tests. X-ray studies of the fingers and/or toes (digits) and clinical examination of the nose, ears, lips, and tongue may be helpful in identifying the disorder. Malformation or absence of the nails may be apparent at birth (congenital).

33,Cystic-Fibrosis,"CFTR A diagnosis of cystic fibrosis may be suspected based upon newborn screening, identification of characteristic symptoms (e.g., pulmonary disease, pancreatic insufficiency) or a positive family history. The standard diagnostic test for cystic fibrosis is the sweat test, a painless and simple procedure that measures the amount of salt in the sweat. Genetic testing can identify carriers of the defective gene. In May 2005, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the first DNA-based blood test to help detect cystic fibrosis. The Tag-It Cystic Fibrosis Kit directly analyzes human DNA to find genetic variations indicative of the disease. All 50 States have newborn screening for CF. In most states, immunoreactive trypsinogen (IRT) assays are performed on dried blood spots from newborns. Trypsinogen is synthesized in the pancreas and IRT levels are elevated in CF. Abnormal IRT results are followed up with sweat testing and/or molecular genetic (DNA-based) testing to confirm the diagnosis.","Cystic Fibrosis, cystic fibrosis, CF",pulmonary disease,,"pancreatic insufficiency, pulmonary disease"

AP-4-HSP is likely under-recognized since the symptoms (phenotypic spectrum) largely overlap with that of cerebral palsy and, in the absence of genetic testing, patients may be misdiagnosed as having cerebral palsy. Many of the initial clinical manifestations of AP-4-associated HSP are nonspecific and may resemble other disorders characterized by spasticity, developmental delay / intellectual disability, and seizures. Patients may be misdiagnosed as having cerebral palsy. The diagnosis of AP-4-associated HSP is based on clinical characteristics and testing that may include a brain MRI showing characteristic features such as a thin corpus callosum, wide lateral ventricles and changes in the white matter. A definitive diagnosis is reached by genetic testing.","AP-4-HSP, AP-4-associated HSP","intellectual disability, cerebral palsy",,"seizures, developmental delay, intellectual disability, spasticity"
36,Succinic-Semialdehyde-Dehydrogenase-Deficiency,"Succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase (SSADH) deficiency is a rare inborn error of metabolism that is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. In individuals with the disorder, deficient activity of the SSADH enzyme disrupts the metabolism of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). GABA is a natural chemical known as a ""neurotransmitter"" that serves to inhibit the electrical activities of nerve cells (inhibitory neurotransmitter). SSADH deficiency leads to abnormal accumulation of the compound succinic semialdehyde, which is reduced or converted to 4-hydroxybutyric acid, also known as GHB (gamma-hydroxybutyric acid). GHB is a natural compound that has a wide range of effects within the nervous system. The ""hallmark"" laboratory finding associated with SSADH deficiency is elevated levels of GHB in the urine (i.e., 4-hydroxybutyric or gamma-hydroxybutyric aciduria), the liquid portion of the blood (plasma), and the fluid that flows through the brain and spinal canal (cerebrospinal fluid [CSF]).","gamma-hydroxybutyric aciduria, Succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase deficiency, SSADH deficiency",,,"elevated levels of GHB in the urine, inborn error of metabolism, 4-hydroxybutyric aciduria, elevated levels of GHB in the CSF, gamma-hydroxybutyric aciduria, elevated levels of GHB in the plasma, succinic semialdehyde is reduced or converted to 4-hydroxybutyric acid also known as GHB, disrupts the metabolism of gamma-aminobutyric acid, deficient activity of the SSADH enzyme, abnormal accumulation of the compound succinic semialdehyde"

41,Dysplasia-Epiphysealis-Hemimelica,"Dysplasia epiphysealis hemimelica (DEH), also known as Trevor’s disease, is a developmental bone disease of childhood. It is rare and clinical experience with this condition is limited. Most cases are diagnosed before 8 years of age. It is characterized by an abnormal growth of cartilage arising from the cartilage of the terminal ends (epiphysis) of the long bones, particularly of the lower limbs. The bones of the knee and ankle joints are most commonly affected, as well as part of the foot (tarsal bones). The upper limbs and spine are rarely involved. The abnormal cartilage produces an irregular nodular mass located either in the medial or lateral part of the bone (hemimelic), usually medial. DEH may affect a single bone (localized form), multiple bones in a single limb (classical form) or an entire limb (generalized) usually involving a leg from the pelvis to the foot. Approximately two-thirds of affected children have multiple lesions. DEH was first described in the medical literature in 1926. Trevor recognized this condition in 1950. The name, dysplasia epiphysealis hemimelica first appeared in the medical literature in 1956. The cause of DEH is unknown. There is no evidence that hereditary factors play a role in the development of this disease. More research is necessary to determine the exact underlying cause(s) of this disorder. DEH is benign and there are no reports of malignant transformation of the cartilage abnormality. DEH usually affects children between the ages of 1 and 15. Males are affected more often than females. The incidence of DEH has been estimated at 1 in 1,000,000 individuals in the general population. However, some authors consider that the incidence is probably higher because some patients may be misdiagnosed with other conditions.","DEH, dysplasia epiphysealis hemimelica, Trevor’s disease,, Dysplasia epiphysealis hemimelica",bone disease,,"abnormal growth of cartilage arising from the cartilage of the terminal ends (epiphysis) of the long bones, irregular nodular mass located either in the medial or lateral part of the bone, abnormal growth of cartilage arising from the cartilage of the terminal ends (epiphysis) of the long bones of the lower limbs, abnormal cartilage"
42,Waldenstrom_s-Macroglobulinemia,"Waldenström's macroglobulinemia (WMG) is a malignant disorder of the bone marrow and lymphatic tissues, a type of lymphoma and characterized by the presence of abnormally large numbers of a particular kind of white blood cell known as B lymphocytes. As these cells accumulate in the body, excessive quantities of an antibody protein known as IgM are produced. Large amounts of IgM cause the blood to become thick (hyperviscosity) and affects the flow of blood through the smaller blood vessels, leading to some of the symptoms of the disorder. Small blood vessels may tear leading to bleeding in the nose, gums, or retina. Symptoms of Waldenström’s macroglobulinemia usually begin gradually. Common symptoms are fatigue and loss of energy due to anemia. Bleeding from the nose and gums may also occur, and tingling in the fingers and toes is often seen (peripheral neuropathy). Examination may also reveal enlarged liver, spleen, or lymph nodes. Blurring or vision impairment may also occur due to changes in blood flow through the blood vessels that serve the retina. The symptoms are quite variable depending on the effect of the thickened (viscous) blood on the organ involved. The causes of Waldenström’s macroglobulinemia are unknown. There is evidence of occurrence within families, but such occurrence is uncommon. Waldenström’s macroglobulinemia is a very rare disorder affecting about 1 in 3.4 million American men and about half that number of American women. The incidence of WMG is estimated to be about 5 per 1,000,000 people over the age of 50. The median age at diagnosis is 67. However, cases have been diagnosed in patients in their twenties. This disorder is considerably less common among people of African descent. When patients show symptoms of an enlarged spleen and liver combined with bleeding of the retina, WMG is reasonably suspected. The results of a complete blood count (CBC) usually show low red blood cell counts as well as low platelet counts. In such circumstances, electrophoresis (subjecting blood plasma to an electric impulse) of serum samples will show a peak reading for IgM.","Waldenström's macroglobulinemia, Waldenström’s macroglobulinemia, WMG, lymphoma","peripheral neuropathy, malignant disorder of the bone marrow and lymphatic tissues, anemia","fatigue, loss of energy","enlarged liver, bleeding in the retina, bleeding of the retina, excessive quantities of IgM, Large amounts of IgM, enlarged spleen, bleeding in the nose, viscous blood, enlarged lymph nodes, abnormally large numbers of a particular kind of white blood cell known as B lymphocytes, Blurring, tingling in the fingers and toes, blood to become thick, low red blood cell, vision impairment, changes in blood flow through the blood vessels that serve the retina, bleeding in the gums, Bleeding from the gums, Bleeding from the nose, anemia, Small blood vessels tear, low platelet counts"
43,Subacute-Sclerosing-Panencephalitis,"Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) is a progressive neurological disorder characterized by inflammation of the brain (encephalitis). The disease may develop due to reactivation of the measles virus or an inappropriate immune response to the measles virus. SSPE usually develops 2 to 10 years after the original viral attack. Initial symptoms may include memory loss, irritability, seizures, involuntary muscle movements, and/or behavioral changes, leading to neurological deterioration. With widespread uss of the measles vaccine in the United States, the incidence of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis has been reduced dramatically, although about 10 cases per year are reported. However, in less developed parts of the world, this disorder is much more common.  In India, for example, the incidence is estimated at about 20 cases per year per million of population.  Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis seems to affect males more often than females and occurs far more often in children and adolescents than in adults.","encephalitis, Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis, SSPE, subacute sclerosing panencephalitis","measles, neurological disorder",,"irritability, behavioral changes, encephalitis, involuntary muscle movements, neurological deterioration, memory loss, seizures"

With symptom onset, affected individuals may develop confusion, depression, behavioral changes, impaired vision, and/or impaired coordination. As the disease progresses, there may be rapidly progressive deterioration of cognitive processes and memory (dementia), resulting in confusion and disorientation, impairment of memory control, personality disintegration, agitation, restlessness, and other symptoms and findings. Affected individuals also develop neuromuscular abnormalities such as muscle weakness and loss of muscle mass (wasting); irregular, rapid, shock-like muscle spasms (myoclonus); and/or relatively slow, involuntary, continual writhing movements (athetosis), particularly of the arms and legs. Later stages of the disease may include further loss of physical and intellectual functions, a state of unconsciousness (coma), and increased susceptibility to repeated infections of the respiratory tract (e.g., pneumonia). In many affected individuals, life-threatening complications may develop less than a year after the disorder becomes apparent.","Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, CJD, spongiform encephalopathy","degenerative brain disorder, dementia, infections of the respiratory trac, pneumonia","rapidly progressive neuromuscular symptoms, confusion, disorientation, rapidly progressive neurological symptoms","loss of physical and intellectual functions, impairment of memory control, myoclonus, behavioral changes, agitation, depression, restlessness, coma, wasting, personality disintegration, dementia, impaired vision, athetosis, impaired coordination, neuromuscular abnormalities, muscle weakness"
45,Leukodystrophy,"Leukodystrophies are a group of rare, progressive, metabolic, genetic diseases that affect the brain, spinal cord and often the peripheral nerves. Each type of leukodystrophy is caused by a specific gene abnormality that leads to abnormal development or destruction of the white matter (myelin sheath) of the brain. The myelin sheath is the protective covering of the nerve and nerves can't function normally without it. Each type of leukodystrophy affects a different part of the myelin sheath, leading to a range of neurological problems. The leukodystrophies can affect either adults or children, but are more common in children. Some types of leukodystrophy affect males and females equally but other types predominantly affect males. Treatment of most leukodystrophies is symptomatic and supportive. Medications and physical therapy may be helpful for spasticity and motor difficulties. Anti-epileptic medications should be provided for seizures and burning paresthesia from peripheral neuropathy may respond to medications for neuropathic pain. Please review the NORD report on the specific type of leukodystrophy for information about successful therapies. Genetic counseling is beneficial for affected individuals and their families.","leukodystrophy, Leukodystrophies, leukodystrophies","progressive, metabolic, genetic diseases, peripheral neuropathy",neuropathic pain,"burning paresthesia, motor difficulties, abnormal development or destruction of the white matter (myelin sheath) of the brain, spasticity, peripheral neuropathy, seizures"
46,Ichthyosis-Lamellar,"Lamellar ichthyosis is a rare genetic skin disorder. In lamellar ichthyosis, the skin cells are produced at a normal rate, but they do not separate normally at the surface of the outermost layer of skin (stratum corneum) and are not shed as quickly as they should be. The result of this retention is the formation of scale. Lamellar ichthyosis is a very rare disorder occurring in less than one in 200,000 people.  Lamellar ichthyosis is not limited by gender, race or ethnicity; it occurs in all populations. Lamellar ichthyosis is treated topically with skin barrier repair formulas containing ceramides or cholesterol, moisturizers with petrolatum or lanolin, and mild keratolytics (products containing alpha-hydroxy acids.. Severe lamellar ichthyosis can be treated systemically with oral synthetic retinoids.

50,Myopathy-Congenital-Batten-Turner-Type,"Batten Turner Type Congenital Myopathy is an extremely rare, inherited muscle disease (myopathy) and is characterized by the lack of muscle tone or floppiness at birth (congenital hypotonia). The symptoms of Batten Turner Type Congenital Myopathy are slowly progressive during infancy and childhood. However, this disorder is not progressive in adulthood. The first symptoms of Batten Turner Type Congenital Myopathy in a newborn are the slow, progressive loss of muscle tone characterized by floppiness (hypotonia) and general weakness.  Early motor skills and other important developmental milestones may be slightly delayed.  Toddlers with this disorder usually have mild muscle weakness and may be prone to falling or stumbling.  The muscles of the pelvis, neck, and shoulder area are most commonly affected.  Since the symptoms of this disease are not progressive during adulthood, most people with Batten Turner Type Congenital Myopathy walk normally as adults.  However, some physical activities may be slightly impaired. Batten Turner Type Congenital Myopathy is inherited as an autosomal recessive genetic trait.  Human traits, including the classic genetic diseases, are the product of the interaction of two genes, one received from the father and one from the mother.  In recessive disorders, the condition does not appear unless a person inherits the same defective gene for the same trait from each parent.  If an individual receives one normal gene and one gene for the disease, the person will be a carrier for the disease, but usually will not show symptoms.  The risk of transmitting the disease to the children of a couple, both of whom are carriers for a recessive disorder, is 25 percent. Fifty percent of their children risk being carriers of the disease, but generally will not show symptoms of the disorder.  Twenty-five percent of their children may receive both normal genes, one from each parent, and will be genetically normal (for that particular trait).  The risk is the same for each pregnancy. Batten Turner Type Congenital Myopathy is an extremely rare disorder that affects males and females in equal numbers.  The symptoms of this disorder are most obvious during infancy and childhood.  Nine cases of Batten Turner Type Congenital Myopathy have been described in the medical literature.  Six of these cases were reported in one family. Adults with Batten Turner Type Congenital Myopathy should be encouraged to get adequate exercise and to avoid obesity.

51,Chromosome-9-Ring,"Chromosome 9 Ring is a rare disorder in which there is loss (deletion) of chromosomal material from both ends of the 9th chromosome and joining of the ends to form a ring. Associated symptoms and findings may vary, depending upon the amount and location of lost chromosomal material and other factors. Some affected individuals may have variable malformations of the skull and facial (craniofacial) region. However, in others with the chromosomal abnormality, such features may not be apparent. Chromosome 9 Ring may also be characterized by additional physical features in some cases, including growth retardation, heart defects, genital abnormalities, and/or other findings. In addition, many affected individuals have moderate to severe intellectual disability; however, in some instances, intelligence may be in the low normal range. Chromosome 9 Ring usually appears to result from spontaneous (de novo) errors very early in the development of the embryo that occur for unknown reasons (sporadically).

52,Glucose,"Glucose-galactose malabsorption is an inherited metabolic disorder characterized by the small intestine's inability to transport and absorb glucose and galactose (simple sugars or monosaccharides). Glucose and galactose have very similar chemical structures, and normally the same transport enzyme provides them with entry into specialized cells in the small intestine where they are absorbed and transferred to other cells. As a result of a mutation on chromosome 22, the transport enzyme does not function properly and the result is glucose-galactose malabsorption. Glucose-galactose malabsorption is an extremely rare disorder.  It’s been estimated that there are approximately 200 cases worldwide. Two-thirds of those affected are females. One report suggests that about half of the cases of severe GGM reported have occurred among families that have experienced intermarriage (consanguinity). The diagnosis is usually made upon review of the presenting signs especially the pervasive, watery diarrhea. A simple test, known as the ""glucose breath hydrogen test"" is often used to confirm the physical diagnosis.","GGM, Glucose-galactose malabsorption, glucose-galactose malabsorption","inherited metabolic disorder, diarrhea",,"watery diarrhea, small intestine's inability to transport and absorb glucose and galactose"
53,Trisomy-9p-(Multiple-Variants),"Trisomy 9p is a rare chromosomal syndrome in which a portion of the 9th chromosome appears three times (trisomy) rather than twice in cells of the body. Chromosomes are found in the nucleus of all body cells. They carry the genetic characteristics of each individual. Pairs of human chromosomes are numbered from 1 through 22, with an unequal 23rd pair of X and Y chromosomes for males and two X chromosomes for females. Each chromosome has a short arm designated as ""p,"" a long arm identified by the letter ""q,"" and a narrowed region at which the two arms are joined (centromere). Chromosomes are further subdivided into bands that are numbered outward from the centromere. For example, the short arm of chromosome 9 includes bands 9p11 to 9p24, and the long arm includes bands 9q11 to 9q34. In observed cases, trisomy 9p has appeared to affect females approximately twice as frequently as males. As of 2013, more than 150 cases have been reported in the medical literature since the disorder was first described in 1970.

58,Dejerine,"DSS often begins suddenly by age two. Tingling, prickling or burning sensations are usually the first symptoms. Muscle weakness is usually first noticed in the back of the leg. This then spreads to the front leg muscles. Children may have delayed motor milestones, including walking at preschool age or later. Some individuals may need to use a wheelchair by their teenage years. The hand and forearm muscles may become weak as the condition worsens. Individuals with DSS may have respiratory insufficiency, meaning they do not take in enough oxygen or breathe out enough carbon dioxide. Mild vision difficulties may also occur. Other symptoms include pain, loss of heat sensitivity, absence of reflexes, muscle loss (atrophy) of leg muscles, scoliosis (curving of the spine), and ataxia (loss of coordination and balance).

59,Primary-Central-Nervous-System-Lymphoma,"Primary central nervous system lymphoma constitutes 4% of all brain tumors and develops in around five individuals per million each year, for a total of approximately 1,500 new cases per year in the United States. PCNSL is slightly more common in males. The most common risk factor for the development of a primary CNS lymphoma is an impaired immune system (immunosuppression). This is notably the case of patients living with HIV/ AIDS, especially those who are not treated who have a high viral load and low CD4+ cell count. Other immunosuppressed groups include organ transplant recipients and individuals with congenital immunodeficiency syndromes. In fact, primary CNS lymphoma is the most common brain tumor in immunosuppressed patients. The other main risk factor for developing a PCNSL is age. Most immunocompetent patients are diagnosed around age 60, although cases of PCNSL have also been reported in children. AIDS-related PCNSL most often develop during the fifth decade of life (age 40-49).","Primary central nervous system lymphoma, AIDS-related PCNSL, primary CNS lymphoma, PCNSL","brain tumors, congenital immunodeficiency syndromes, AIDS, HIV, brain tumor",,

62,Hypoplastic-Left-Heart-Syndrome,"Hypoplastic left heart syndrome is a term used to describe a group of closely related rare heart defects that are present at birth (congenital). The normal heart has four chambers. The two upper chambers, known as atria, are separated from each other by a fibrous partition known as the atrial septum. The two lower chambers are known as ventricles and are separated from each other by the ventricular septum. Valves connect the atria (left and right) to their respective ventricles. The valves allow for blood to be pumped through the chambers. Blood travels from the right ventricle through the pulmonary artery to the lungs where it receives oxygen. The blood returns to the heart through pulmonary veins and enters the left ventricle. The left ventricle sends the now oxygen-filled blood into the main artery of the body (aorta). The aorta sends the blood throughout the body. Hypoplastic left heart syndrome is a rare disorder that affects males (67 percent) more often than females. The estimated prevalence of the disorder is 1 in 100,000 live births. Hypoplastic left heart syndrome accounts for 7-9 percent of all congenital heart defects. The symptoms of this disorder are present at birth (congenital). The diagnosis of hypoplastic left heart syndrome is made based upon a thorough clinical evaluation, identification of characteristic findings and a variety of specialized tests. Such tests used to confirm hypoplastic left heart syndrome in newborns include x-ray examination and a special ultrasound test to study the structure and function of the heart (echocardiography).","Hypoplastic left heart syndrome, hypoplastic left heart syndrome",congenital heart defects,,
63,Ewing-Sarcoma,"Ewing sarcoma is a rare bone tumor that occurs most often in adolescents. It can also arise outside of the bone in soft tissue (extraosseous Ewing sarcoma). Ewing sarcoma is related to another type of tumor known as primitive neuroectodermal tumor (PNET). Researchers have learned that these tumors are associated with the same chromosomal abnormality (balanced reciprocal translocation) and share many physiological characteristics. Consequently, these tumors are sometimes collectively classified as the Ewing family of tumors (EFT). This general term encompasses Ewing sarcoma of bone, extraosseous Ewing sarcoma, primitive neuroectodermal tumor, and Askin’s tumor (a tumor of the chest wall). Ewing sarcoma of bone accounts for approximately 70 percent of the tumors in this family. Generally, the term Ewing sarcoma is preferred because, despite the different names, it is one tumor, molecularly. Ewing sarcoma of bone most often affects the long bone of the legs (femur) and flat bones such as those found in the pelvis and chest well. Ewing sarcoma is an aggressive cancer that may spread (metastasize) to the lungs, other bones, and bone marrow potentially causing life-threatening complications. The exact cause of these tumors is unknown.","Ewing family of tumors, Askin’s tumor, primitive neuroectodermal tumor, Ewing sarcoma, EFT, PNET, extraosseous Ewing sarcoma","aggressive cancer, bone tumor",,
64,Chromosome-14-Ring,"Chromosome 14 Ring is a rare disorder that is characterized by abnormalities of the 14th chromosome. Affected infants and children typically have delays in the acquisition of skills that require the coordination of physical and mental activities (psychomotor delays), mental retardation, growth delays, and episodes of uncontrolled electrical activity in the brain (seizures). The disorder is also characterized by distinctive abnormalities of the head and facial (craniofacial) area. Such abnormalities may include an unusually small head (microcephaly) with a high forehead; an elongated face; widely spaced eyes (ocular hypertelorism); a thin upper lip; a flat nasal bridge with a prominent nasal tip; and large, low-set ears. Chromosome 14 Ring is an extremely rare chromosomal disorder that has appeared to affect males slightly more often than females.  There have been over 40 cases reported in the medical literature. Additional chromosomal disorders may have features similar to those associated with Chromosome 14 Ring.  Chromosomal testing is necessary to confirm the specific chromosomal abnormality present.

67,Arthritis-Infectious,"Infectious arthritis is an inflammation of one or more joints that occurs as a result of infection by bacteria, viruses or, less frequently, fungi or parasites. The symptoms of Infectious arthritis depend upon which agent has caused the infection but symptoms often include fever, chills, general weakness, and headaches, followed by inflammation and painful swelling of one or more joints of the body. Any disease-causing microbe may infect a joint.  Bacteria are most often responsible, typically producing an acute arthritic attack.  In young children the most common bacteria are staphylococci, haemophilus influenzae, and gram- negative bacilli.  Older children and adults are most commonly infected with gonococci, staphylococci, streptococci or pneumococci.  Acute infectious arthritis at any age may be associated with rubella, mumps or hepatitis B infections.  Fungi and fungi-like bacteria such as mycobacterium tuberculosis, etc may cause chronic infectious arthritis.  People with rheumatoid arthritis and chronically inflamed joints are particularly susceptible to infectious arthritis. Infectious arthritis can affect people of all ages and both sexes.  About half of all cases involve adults over the age of 60.  The incidence is reported as 2-10 cases per 100,000 of general population.  For patients with immunologic disorders, the incidence increases to about 30-70 cases per 100,000 people.  In gonococcal arthritis, the disorder is found in three times as many women as men. A thorough history and physical examination are essential for diagnosis. Blood tests as well as tests of the fluid commonly found in the joints are essential for identification of the infecting agent and to confirm diagnosis. Once the infecting agent is known, an appropriate course of treatment may be designed.","infectious arthritis, Infectious arthritis, gonococcal arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, tuberculosis","hepatitis B, rubella, mumps","headaches, general weakness","hepatitis, inflammation and painful swelling of one or more joints of the body, inflammation of one or more joints, chills, arthritis, fever"
68,Fetal-Hydantoin-Syndrome,Fetal hydantoin syndrome affects males and females in equal numbers. The exact incidence and prevalence of the disorder is unknown. Studies have suggested that approximately 5%-10% of infants exposed to phenytoin during pregnancy will develop fetal hydantoin syndrome. There is no diagnostic testing that can identify fetal hydantoin syndrome. A diagnosis is made clinically based upon identification of characteristic symptoms in an affected infant in conjunction with a history of phenytoin exposure during gestation. It is important to note that the majority of infants born to women who take phenytoin during pregnancy will not develop fetal hydantoin syndrome.,"Fetal hydantoin syndrome, fetal hydantoin syndrome",,,
69,Carnosinemia,"Carnosinemia is a very rare inherited metabolic disorder characterized by developmental delays and seizures. Symptoms can begin during infancy and may include drowsiness, seizures that may be accompanied by involuntary jerking muscle movements of the arms, legs, or head (myoclonic seizures), and intellectual disability. The symptoms of carnosinemia include extreme drowsiness and seizures that can occur in children under the age of one year. Slow growth, low muscle tone, motor delays, and delayed intellectual development also occur in children with this disorder. Seizures may be accompanied by myoclonic seizures. By approximately 2 years of age, affected children show variable degrees of intellectual deficit leading to intellectual disabilities and developmental regression. Some affected children also have muscle weakness (congenital myopathy). Electroencephalogram (EEG), a test that detects electrical activity in the brain, may be abnormal.  A few patients reported with this condition have few or no symptoms. Carnosinemia is a very rare disorder that affects males and females in equal numbers. Approximately 30 individuals with carnosinemia have been reported in the medical literature world-wide. The diagnosis of carnosinemia may be made by testing the levels of amino acids in blood and/or urine, which reveals abnormally high levels of carnosine and anserine in the serum and urine. Very specialized testing of the blood will detect very low activity of the enzyme carnosinase in the blood. Diagnosis is based on amino acid analysis of serum and/or urine after exclusion of meat from the diet.","Carnosinemia, carnosinemia, congenital myopathy","inherited metabolic disorder, intellectual disability",,"myoclonic seizures., myoclonic seizures, motor delays, delayed intellectual development, developmental regression, Slow growth, intellectual disabilities, very low activity of the enzyme carnosinase in the blood, intellectual disability, drowsiness, congenital myopathy, intellectual deficit, abnormally high levels of carnosine and anserine in the serum and urine, seizures, low muscle tone, developmental delays, Seizures"
70,Jejunal-Atresia,"Jejunal Atresia is a rare genetic disorder. Patients with this disorder are born with a partial absence of the fold of the stomach membrane that connects the small intestine to the back wall of the abdomen. As a result, one of the three portions of the small intestine (the jejunal) twists around one of the arteries of the colon called the marginal artery and causes a blockage (atresia). Symptoms in individuals with this disorder include vomiting, a swollen abdomen, and constipation. Jejunal Atresia may be inherited as an autosomal recessive trait, or it may  occur sporadically with no known cause.  Human traits, including the classic  genetic diseases, are the product of the interaction of two genes, one  received from the father and one from the mother.  In recessive disorders,  the condition does not appear unless a person inherits the same defective  gene for the same trait from each parent.  If an individual receives one  normal gene and one gene for the disease, the person will be a carrier for  the disease, but usually will not show symptoms.  The risk of transmitting  the disease to the children of a couple, both of whom are carriers for a  recessive disorder, is 25 percent.  Fifty percent of their children risk  being carriers of the disease, but generally will not show symptoms of the  disorder.  Twenty-five percent of their children may receive both normal  genes, one from each parent, and will be genetically normal (for that particular trait).  The risk is the  same for each pregnancy. Jejunal Atresia is a very rare disorder that affects males and females in equal numbers.  There have been approximately 57 cases reported in the medical literature.",Jejunal Atresia,"classic  genetic diseases, recessive disorders, constipation, recessive disorder, genetic disorder",,"vomiting, the jejunal twists around the marginal arter, swollen abdomen, partial absence of the fold of the stomach membrane that connects the small intestine to the back wall of the abdomen, constipation, atresia"
71,Alagille-Syndrome,"Alagille syndrome (OMIM #118450) is a rare genetic disorder that can affect multiple organ systems of the body including the liver, heart, skeleton, eyes and kidneys. The specific symptoms and severity of Alagille syndrome can vary greatly from one person to another, even within the same family. Some individuals may have mild forms of the disorder while others may have more serious forms. Common symptoms, which often develop during the first three months of life, include blockage of the flow of bile from the liver (cholestasis), yellowing of the skin and mucous membranes (jaundice), poor weight gain and growth, severe itching (pruritis) and pale, loose stools. Additional symptoms include heart murmurs, congenital heart defects, vertebral (back bone) differences, thickening of the ring that normally lines the cornea in the eye (posterior embryotoxon) and distinctive facial features. Most people with Alagille syndrome have mutations in one copy of the JAG1 gene. A small percentage (less than 1 percent) of patients have mutations of the NOTCH2 gene. These mutations are inherited as autosomal dominant traits, however in about half of cases the mutation occurs as a new change (""de novo"") in the individual and was not inherited from a parent. The current estimated incidence of ALGS is between 1:30,000 and 1:45,000 with no difference in gender. Alagille syndrome affects males and females in equal numbers. The incidence of Alagille syndrome has been estimated to be approximately 1 in 30,000-45,000 individuals in the general population. Some cases of Alagille syndrome may go undiagnosed or misdiagnosed making it difficult to determine the true frequency of Alagille syndrome in the general population.","Alagille syndrome, ALGS","genetic disorder, congenital heart defects, cholestasis",,"distinctive facial features, vertebral differences, cholestasis, pale, loose stools, poor weight gain, congenital heart defects, jaundice, heart murmurs, pruritis, poor growth, thickening of posterior embryotoxon"
72,Elephantiasis,"Elephantiasis is a condition characterized by gross enlargement of an area of the body, especially the limbs. Other areas commonly affected include the external genitals. Elephantiasis is caused by obstruction of the lymphatic system, which results in the accumulation of a fluid called lymph in the affected areas. A diagnosis of elephantiasis is made based upon a thorough clinical evaluation, a detailed patient history and identification of characteristic symptoms. A variety of tests may be used to determine the underlying cause of lymphatic damage and subsequent elephantiasis.",,"Elephantiasis, elephantiasis",,"obstruction of the lymphatic system, gross enlargement of an area of the body, especially the limbs, accumulation of a fluid called lymph in the affected areas"
73,West-Syndrome,"West syndrome is a constellation of symptoms characterized by epileptic/infantile spasms, abnormal brain wave patterns called hypsarrhythmia and intellectual disability. The spasms that occur may range from violent jackknife or ""salaam"" movements where the whole body bends in half, or they may be no more than a mild twitching of the shoulder or eye changes. These spasms usually begin in the early months after birth and can sometimes be helped with medication. They can also occur in older patients; if this happens, they are called ""epileptic spasms"" rather than infantile spasms. Currently, the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) has revised the terminology and epileptic spasms is now preferentially used to encompass the different age groups of onset. There are many different causes of epileptic spasms and if a specific cause can be identified, a diagnosis of symptomatic epileptic spasms can be made. If a cause cannot be determined, a diagnosis of cryptogenic epileptic spasms is made.","infantile spasms, West syndrome",intellectual disability,,"infantile spasms, spasms, mild twitching of the shoulder, salaam movements, abnormal brain wave patterns, intellectual disability, hypsarrhythmia, violent jackknife, epileptic spasms, eye changes"
74,Hyperferritinemia-Cataract-Syndrome,"Hyperferritinemia-cataract syndrome is an extremely rare disorder that affects males and females in equal numbers. More than 100 families with the disorder have been described in the medical literature. The prevalence of hyperferritinemia-cataract syndrome has been estimated at 1 in 200,000 people in the general population. Because the disorder is so rare, it often goes unrecognized or undiagnosed, making it difficult to determine the disorder’s true frequency in the general population. Hyperferritinemia-cataract syndrome was first described in the medical literature in 1995. A diagnosis of hyperferritinemia-cataract syndrome is made based upon identification of characteristic symptoms (e.g., cataracts), a detailed patient history, a thorough clinical evaluation and a variety of specialized tests such as blood tests, which can reveal elevated levels of ferritin in the blood plasma.","hyperferritinemia-cataract syndrome, Hyperferritinemia-cataract syndrome",,,elevated levels of ferritin in the blood plasma
75,Mikulicz-Syndrome,"Mikulicz syndrome is a chronic condition characterized by the abnormal enlargement of glands in the head and neck, including those near the ears (parotids) and those around the eyes (lacrimal) and mouth (salivary). The tonsils and other glands in the soft tissue of the face and neck may also be involved. Although the disorder is almost always described as benign, it always occurs in association with another underlying disorder such as tuberculosis, leukemia, syphilis, Hodgkin's disease, lymphosarcoma, Sjögren syndrome, or lupus (SLE). People who have Mikulicz syndrome are at heightened risk for developing lymphomas. Mikulicz syndrome is characterized by the sudden onset of extreme dryness in the mouth (xerostomia) that may lead to difficulty swallowing and tooth decay.  Other symptoms include enlarged tear glands (lacrimal glands), leading to absent or decreased tears; enlarged glands in the neck (parotid glands); hard, painless swellings (tumefactions) of the saliva glands (salivary glands) of the mouth and those near the ears (parotid).   Glands near the jaw (submaxillary) may also become swollen.  Symptoms may persist for long periods of time or come and go with frequent recurrences. The symptoms of Mikulicz syndrome are very similar to those of Sjögren syndrome and some researchers suspect that they may be the same disorder (see Related Disorders section of this report).","tuberculosis, Mikulicz syndrome, Sjögren syndrome, lupus, Hodgkin's disease, SLE, lymphomas","syphilis, lymphosarcoma, leukemia",,"parotids enlargement of glands in the, xerostomia, enlarged lacrimal glands, tooth decay, leading to absent or decreased tears, Glands submaxillary swollen, enlarged parotid glands, enlargement of glands in the head and neck, difficulty swallowing, tumefactions of the salivary glands, salivary enlargement of glands, lacrimal enlargement of glands"
76,Meige-Syndrome,"Meige syndrome is a rare neurological movement disorder characterized by involuntary and often forceful contractions of the muscles of the jaw and tongue (oromandibular dystonia) and involuntary muscle spasms and contractions of the muscles around the eyes (blepharospasm). The specific symptoms and their severity vary from case to case. Meige syndrome affects women more often than men. Symptoms typically begin in middle-age between 40-70 years, although cases have been reported in individuals much younger. The disorder was first described in detail in the medical literature in 1910 by French neurologist Henry Meige. No tests exist to diagnose Meige syndrome.

78,Monilethrix,"Monilethrix is a rare inherited disorder characterized by sparse, dry, and/or brittle hair that often breaks before reaching more than a few inches in length. The hair may lack luster, and there may be patchy areas of hair loss (alopecia). Another common symptom may be the appearance of elevated spots (papules) surrounding the hair follicles that may be covered with gray or brown crusts or scales (perifollicular hyperkeratosis). When viewed under a microscope, the hair shaft resembles a string of evenly-spaced beads. In most cases, monilethrix is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait. Monilethrix affects males and females in equal numbers.  The exact number of people affected by this disorder is not known.  Monilethrix may be apparent at birth or by the age of two years.

80,Floating-Harbor-Syndrome,"Floating-Harbor syndrome affects males and females in equal numbers. The exact incidence and prevalence of the disorder is unknown. Because cases may go undiagnosed or misdiagnosed, determining the true frequency of FHS in the general population is difficult. As of 2014, approximately 100 cases have been reported in the medical literature. However, some of these individuals do not fit the classical description of FHS and were found not to carry mutations in the SRCAP gene.","FHS, Floating-Harbor syndrome",,,
81,Antiphospholipid-Syndrome,"Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is a rare autoimmune disorder characterized by recurring blood clots (thromboses). Blood clots can form in any blood vessel of the body. The specific symptoms and severity of APS vary greatly from person to person depending upon the exact location of a blood clot and the organ system affected. APS may occur as an isolated disorder (primary antiphospholipid syndrome) or may occur along with another autoimmune disorder such as systemic lupus erythematosus (secondary antiphospholipid syndrome). APS affects males and females, but a large percentage of primary APS patients are women with recurrent pregnancy loss. Some estimates suggest that 1 in 5 cases of recurrent miscarriages or deep vein thromboses are due to APS. As many as one-third of cases of stroke in people under 50 years of age may be due to APS. Secondary APS occurs mainly in lupus, and about 90% of lupus patients are female.","systemic lupus erythematosus, secondary antiphospholipid syndrome, Antiphospholipid syndrome, APS, primary antiphospholipid syndrome, Secondary APS","lupus, autoimmune disorder, stroke",,thromboses
82,Retroperitoneal-Fibrosis,"Retroperitoneal fibrosis is a rare inflammatory disorder in which abnormal formation of fiber-like tissue (fibrosis) occurs behind the membrane that lines the cavity of the abdomen (peritoneum). This abnormal tissue growth often spreads to affect the tubes that carry urine from the kidney to the bladder (ureters). Often these tubes become blocked by the excess tissue. Specific symptoms may vary depending upon the exact location of tissue growth and how far it spreads. In most cases the cause of this disorder is unknown (idiopathic). The exact cause of retroperitoneal fibrosis is not known in about two-thirds of the affected individuals (idiopathic). A drug used in the treatment and prevention of migraine headaches (methysergide) may be the cause of this rare disorder in 12 percent of cases. Malignant tumors are associated with retroperitoneal fibrosis in eight percent of affected individuals. Tissue that has been injured by trauma or surgery may be a factor in some cases. Retroperitoneal fibrosis affects males twice as often as females. The majority of cases occur in individuals between 40 and 60 years of age. However, the disorder can occur at any age, although it is extremely rare in children.","Retroperitoneal fibrosis, retroperitoneal fibrosis",inflammatory disorder,methysergide,"Malignant tumors, abnormal tissue growth often spreads to affect the ureters, ureters blocked by the excess tissue, fibrosis behind the peritoneum, tissue growth"

People with AGAT typically present with mild to moderate intellectual disabilities, delayed speech, and may have seizure activity. Some individuals may develop autistic like behaviors. Children with AGAT may not gain weight and grow at the expected rate (failure to thrive), and have delayed development of motor skills such as sitting and walking. Affected individuals may also have weak muscle tone and tend to tire easily. Fewer than 20 patients with AGAT have reported worldwide. CCDS patients are frequently misdiagnosed with cerebral palsy as infants and toddlers. Children are often misdiagnosed with autism or global developmental delays.","AGAT, CCDS","global developmental delays, autism, cerebral palsy",,"delayed development of motor skills, intellectual disabilities, failure to thrive, seizure, delayed speech"
84,Balo-Disease,"Most cases are characterized by the gradual onset of symptoms that might be found in the more common type of MS, including muscle spasms and paralysis. Other neurological symptoms develop depending on the areas of the brain that are affected and may include intellectual impairment and/or physiological abnormalities. However, in its most serious form, Balo Disease may also suggest the presence of an infectious disease, starting with a high fever and painful headaches. The cause of MS and its variants remains unknown. However, some studies indicate that autoimmune factors may play a role in the development of Balo Disease. Autoimmune disorders are caused when the body’s natural defenses against “foreign” or invading organisms (e.g., antibodies) begin to attack healthy tissue for unknown reasons. Balo Disease is a rare disorder that affects males and females in equal numbers. More cases have been reported from China and the Philippines than elsewhere. Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Corticosteroids are usually useful in decreasing severity of acute presentations through their anti-inflammatory actions. Treatment to relieve symptoms, such as spasticity, weakness, pain, or ataxia, includes pharmacologic and rehabilitative modalities.",Balo Disease,"Autoimmune disorders, MS, infectious disease","weakness, pain","high fever, muscle spasms, paralysis, spasticity, intellectual impairment, ataxia, physiological abnormalities, painful headaches"
85,Ovotesticular-Disorder-of-Sex-Development,"Ovotesticular disorder of sex development (ovotesticular DSD) is a very rare disorder in which an infant is born with the internal reproductive organs (gonads) of both sexes (female ovaries and male testes). The gonads can be any combination of ovary, testes or combined ovary and testes (ovotestes). The external genitalia are usually ambiguous but can range from normal male to normal female. Ovotesticular DSD is the rarest disorder of sex development in humans and has an approximate incidence of less than 1/20,000. At least 500 affected individuals have been reported.

86,Pseudocholinesterase-Deficiency,"Pseudocholinesterase deficiency is an uncommon genetic disorder that makes an affected person very sensitive to any of several anesthetic agents, especially those derived from the drug known as choline. When anesthetic drugs such as succinylcholine or mivacurium are administered to a susceptible person, the muscles that work the lungs may become paralyzed. Mechanical ventilation is essential until the excess anesthetic agent is metabolized and normal breathing is resumed. Individuals with pseudocholinesterase deficiency have a shortage or absence of the enzyme pseudocholinesterase in their blood serum.  If the drug succinylcholine (or another anesthetic derivative of choline) is given during surgery, the respiratory muscles become paralyzed and the patient stops breathing (apnea).  Artificial respiration (mechanical ventilation) may be necessary until the drug is eliminated from the body and the affected individual is able to resume breathing.  If the person with pseudocholinesterase deficiency is not exposed to a choline-derived anesthetic, he or she may never be aware of having a deficiency of the enzyme pseudocholinesterase. Pseudocholinesterase deficiency is present at birth and occurs in approximately 1 out of every 1,500 to 2,500 people in the United States.  Among Caucasian Americans, it seems to affect males almost twice as often as females. Apnea is the temporary cessation of breathing during sleep.  Infantile apnea refers to pauses in breathing during an infant’s sleep.  Apnea is called central apnea or diaphragmatic apnea when there are no chest movements during the pauses in breathing.  When there are chest movements but no passage of air through the mouth or nostrils, the disorder is known as obstructive apnea or upper airway apnea.  Central apnea followed by or intermixed with an obstructive apnea is called mixed apnea.

Although many features of VACTERL association are apparent at birth, some features will not be apparent for weeks, months, or perhaps years. The recurrence risk of VACTERL association for parents with one affected child is about two-three percent. No specific test in actually available for prenatal diagnosis, although fetal ultrasound scan may be of some help to exclude recurrence. Because the cause of VACTERL association is unknown, no laboratory test exists that can diagnose or rule out VACTERL association. The diagnosis is a clinical diagnosis based on the features seen. It may take some time to do all the testing necessary to make a diagnosis of VACTERL association. A diagnosis may be made based upon a complete physical exam and a variety of specialized tests that look for the major and minor features of VACTERL association listed above.",VACTERL association,,,
88,Empty-Sella-Syndrome,"Empty sella syndrome is a rare disorder characterized by enlargement or malformation of a structure in the skull known as the sella turcica. The sella turcica is a saddle-shaped depression located in the bone at the base of skull (sphenoid bone), in which resides the pituitary gland. In empty sella syndrome, the sella turcica is either partially filled with cerebrospinal fluid and a very small associated pituitary gland lying in the floor of the sella (partially empty sella) or completely filled with cerebrospinal fluid with no visualized pituitary gland (completely empty sella). Most individuals with empty sella syndrome do not have any associated symptoms, but the finding raises concerns about hormone deficiencies. Empty sella syndrome may occur as a primary disorder, for which the cause is unknown (idiopathic), or as a secondary disorder, in which it occurs due to an underlying condition or disorder such as a treated pituitary tumor, head trauma, or a condition known as idiopathic intracranial hypertension (also called pseudotumor cerebri) during which elevated intracranial pressure causes empty sella syndrome. Primary empty sella syndrome affects approximately 4 times more women than men. Most cases occur in middle-aged women who are obese and have high blood pressure (hypertension). Because most people with empty sella syndrome do not have symptoms and may go undiagnosed, determining the disorder’s true frequency in the general population is difficult. Some researchers have estimated that less than 1 percent of individuals with empty sella syndrome ultimately develop symptoms associated with the disorder, although this may be higher in men compared to women. A diagnosis of empty sella syndrome is made based upon identification of characteristic symptoms, a detailed patient history, a thorough clinical evaluation and specialized imaging techniques. Imaging may include computerized tomography (CT) scanning and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). During CT scanning, a computer and x-rays are used to create a film showing cross-sectional images of certain tissue structures. An MRI uses a magnetic field and radio waves to produce cross-sectional images of particular organs, tissues and structures such as the sella turcica.","partially empty sella, Primary empty sella syndrome, idiopathic intracranial hypertension, pituitary tumor, completely empty sella, Empty sella syndrome, pseudotumor cerebri, empty sella syndrome",hypertension,,"completely filled with cerebrospinal fluid with no visualized pituitary gland, sella turcica is either partially filled with cerebrospinal fluid, very small associated pituitary gland lying in the floor of the sella, elevated intracranial, hormone deficiencies, sella turcica enlargement or malformation of, hypertension"
89,Agenesis-of-Corpus-Callosum,"Agenesis of corpus callosum (ACC) is a rare disorder that is present at birth (congenital). It is characterized by a partial or complete absence (agenesis) of an area of the brain that connects the two cerebral hemispheres. This part of the brain is normally composed of transverse fibers. The cause of agenesis of corpus callosum is usually not known, but it can be inherited as either an autosomal recessive trait or an X-linked dominant trait. It can also be caused by an infection or injury during the twelfth to the twenty-second week of pregnancy (intrauterine) leading to developmental disturbance of the fetal brain. Intrauterine exposure to alcohol (Fetal alcohol syndrome) can also result in ACC. In some cases mental retardation may result, but intelligence may be only mildly impaired and subtle psychosocial symptoms may be present. Agenesis of Corpus Callosum produces symptoms during the first two years of life in approximately ninety percent of those affected. It has been thought to be a very rare condition but the increased use of neuro-imaging techniques, such as MRI, is resulting in an increased rate of diagnosis.  This condition may also be identified during pregnancy through an ultrasound.  Currently, the highest estimate of incidence is 7 in 1000 individuals. Agenesis of corpus callosum can occur in conjunction with spina bifida. Spina bifida is a term meaning open (or non-fused) spine.  In spina bifida, one or more of the individual bones of the spine fails to close completely, leaving a cleft or defect in the spinal canal. Part of the contents of the spine can protrude or herniate through this abnormal opening that produces a meningocele or meningomyelocele.

90,Pycnodysostosis,"Pycnodysostosis is an extremely rare disorder that affects both males and females. About 200 people have been reported in the medical literature with this disorder. It is estimated to affect about 1 in 1.7 million people in the general discussion. Pycnodysostosis may go undiagnosed or misdiagnosed, making it difficult to determine the true frequency in the general population.",Pycnodysostosis,,,
91,Human-Monocytic-Ehrlichiosis-(HME),"Human Monocytic Ehrlichiosis (HME) is a rare infectious disease belonging to a group of diseases known as the Human Ehrlichioses. These diseases are caused by bacteria belonging to the ""Ehrlichia"" family. Several forms of Human Ehrlichioses have been identified, including Human Monocytic Ehrlichiosis, Sennetsu Fever, and Human Granulocytic Ehrlichiosis. Though caused by different strains of Ehrlichia bacteria, the disorders are characterized by similar symptoms.","Human Monocytic Ehrlichiosis, Sennetsu Fever, Human Granulocytic Ehrlichiosis, HME, Human Ehrlichioses",infectious disease,,Fever
92,Buerger_s-Disease,"Buerger's disease, also known as thromboangiitis obliterans, is a rare disorder that, in most cases, affects young or middle-aged male cigarette smokers. It is characterized by narrowing or blockage (occlusion) of the veins and arteries of the extremities, resulting in reduced blood flow to these areas (peripheral vascular disease). The legs are affected more often than the arms. In most cases, the first symptom is extreme pain of the lower arms and legs while at rest. Affected individuals may also experience cramping in the legs when they walk that, in rare cases, may cause limping (claudication). In addition, affected individuals may have sores (ulcers) on the extremities, numbness and tingling and a lack of normal blood flow to the fingers and/or toes when exposed to cold temperatures (Raynaud's phenomenon), and/or inflammation and clotting of certain veins (thrombophlebitis). In severe cases, individuals with Buerger's disease may exhibit tissue death (gangrene) of affected limbs. The exact cause of Buerger's disease is not known; however, most affected individuals are heavy tobacco users. A diagnosis of Buerger's disease may be made based upon the identification of characteristic physical features and symptoms. Many physicians require a history of recent or current tobacco use in a diagnosis of Buerger's disease. A test such as an angiography or noninvasive techniques may be used to confirm a diagnosis. During an angiography, injection of a specialized dye is used to make the blood vessels visible on x-rays.","Buerger's disease, thromboangiitis obliterans","thrombophlebitis, peripheral vascular disease","extreme pain of the legs, extreme pain of the lower arms while at rest","thrombophlebitis, cramping in the legs when they walk, ulcers on the extremities, claudication, gangrene, narrowing or blockage (occlusion) of the veins and arteries of the extremities, peripheral vascular disease, Raynaud's phenomenon"
93,Cat-Eye-Syndrome,"Cat eye syndrome (CES) is a rare chromosomal disorder that may be evident at birth. Individuals with a normal chromosomal make-up have two 22nd chromosomes, both of which have a short arm, known as 22p, and a long arm, known as 22q. However, in individuals with CES, the short arm and a small region of the long arm of chromosome 22 (i.e., 22pter-22q11) are present four times (partial tetrasomy) rather than twice in cells of the body. In a small number of people with CES, the 22q11 region is present in 3 copies (partial trisomy).  The name “cat eye syndrome” is derived from a distinctive eye (ocular) abnormality that is present in a little over half affected individuals. This defect, known as a coloboma, usually appears as a cleft or gap in the iris below the pupil, and the elongated pupil therefore resembles the appearance of a cat’s eye. There are, however, many other features associated with CES involving many organs and systems. These symptoms result from abnormal development during embryo and fetal stages. Associated symptoms vary greatly in presence and severity from one person to another, including among members of the same family. CES may be best thought of as a disorder spectrum. While some people may have few or mild manifestations, others may have multiple severe malformations. CES has been recognized for more than a century. More than 100 cases have been described in the medical literature, including apparently sporadic and familial cases. Many more affected individuals exist but have not been described in the medical literature. However, the syndrome is very rare, and currently there are no accurate estimates of the incidence of CES in the population. Schinzel et al (1981) estimated an incidence of approximately one in 50,000 to one in 150,000 individuals in Northeastern Switzerland. Because some affected individuals develop few associated features, however, the disorder may in some people remain unrecognized. There is currently no way to estimate how underdiagnosed this syndrome is.","CES, cat eye syndrome, Cat eye syndrome","coloboma, chromosomal disorder",,"eye abnormality, elongated pupil, coloboma, gap in the iris below the pupil, appearance of a cat’s eye"
94,Cornelia-de-Lange-Syndrome,"Cornelia de Lange syndrome (CdLS) is a rare genetic disorder that is apparent at birth (congenital). Associated symptoms and findings typically include delays in physical development before and after birth (prenatal and postnatal growth retardation); characteristic abnormalities of the head and facial (craniofacial) area, resulting in a distinctive facial appearance; malformations of the hands and arms (upper limbs); and mild to severe intellectual disability. Many infants and children with the disorder have an unusually small, short head (microbrachycephaly); a prominent vertical groove between the upper lip and nose (philtrum); a depressed nasal bridge; upturned nostrils (anteverted nares); and a protruding upper jaw (maxillary prognathism) with small chin (micrognathia). Additional characteristic facial abnormalities may include thin, downturned lips; low-set ears; arched, well-defined eyebrows that grow together across the base of the nose (synophrys); an unusually low hairline on the forehead and the back of the neck; and curly, unusually long eyelashes. Affected individuals may also have distinctive malformations of the limbs, such as unusually small hands and feet, inward deviation (clinodactyly) of the fifth fingers, and webbing (syndactyly) of certain toes. Less commonly, there may be absence of the forearms, hands, and fingers. Infants with CdLS may also have feeding and breathing difficulties; an increased susceptibility to respiratory infections; a low-pitched ""growling"" cry and low voice; heart defects; delayed skeletal maturation; hearing loss; or other physical abnormalities. The range and severity of associated symptoms and findings may be extremely variable from person to person. CdLS is a very rare disorder that is apparent at birth (congenital). Males and females appear to be affected in equal numbers. It has been estimated that CdLS occurs in approximately one in every 10,000 live births in the United States. More than 400 cases have been reported in the medical literature, including affected individuals within several families (kindreds). Multiple affected siblings have been reported in some families. It is estimated that there is a 1-2 % rate of recurrence within affected families.","CdLS), Cornelia de Lange syndrome, CdLS","genetic disorder, syndactyly, respiratory infection, intellectual disability",,"low hairline on the forehead and the back of the neck, malformations of the upper limbs, anteverted nares, thin, downturned lips, low-set ears, depressed nasal bridge, intellectual disability, clinodactyly, physical abnormalities, abnormalities of the head and facial (craniofacial) area, small hands, malformations of the limbs, delayed skeletal maturation, distinctive facial appearance, micrognathia, synophrys, absence of the forearms, hands, and fingers, ""low-pitched """"growling"""" cry and low voice"", microbrachycephaly, feeding difficulties, syndactyly, postnatal growth retardation, prenatal growth retardation, curly, unusually long eyelashes, prominent vertical philtrum, breathing difficulties, characteristic facial abnormalities, small feet, maxillary prognathism, heart defects, hearing loss"
95,Turner-Syndrome,"Turner syndrome affects approximately 1 female in 2,000-2,500 live female births. It is estimated that more than 70,000 women and girls in the United States have Turner syndrome. There are no known racial or ethnic factors that influence frequency of the disorder. In some cases, the disorder is diagnosed before birth or shortly after birth. However, mild cases can remain undiagnosed until later in life and even during adulthood.",Turner syndrome,,,
96,Townes-Brocks-Syndrome,"Townes-Brocks syndrome (TBS) is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder characterized by absence of the anal opening (imperforate anus), abnormal ears associated with hearing impairment and thumb malformations. Abnormalities in the feet, heart and kidneys also occur frequently. Townes-Brocks syndrome is associated with a mutation in the SALL1 gene. The absence of the anal opening (imperforate anus) is the most common feature of TBS.   Small ears and a folded rim of skin and cartilage around the outer ear are usually present.  Congenital sensorineural and/or conductive hearing loss can range from mild to severe and can be progressive.   The most common thumb malformations are three bones instead of two (triphalangeal thumbs) and duplicated thumbs (preaxial polydactyly).  Feet anomalies occur less frequently and include a short third toe, overlapping toes and flat feet.  Kidney dysfunction can occur with or without kidney malformations.   Typical kidney anomalies include displaced or rotated kidneys, horseshoe kidney, polycystic kidneys, and underdeveloped kidneys.  Abnormalities of the heart, eye and spine are infrequently associated with Townes-Brocks syndrome.  Mental retardation occurs in approximately 10% of affected individuals. Townes-Brocks syndrome is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder.  Dominant genetic disorders occur when only a single copy of an abnormal gene is necessary for the appearance of the disease.  The SALL1 gene is the only gene known to be associated with Townes-Brocks syndrome.  The abnormal gene can be inherited from either parent, or can be the result of a new mutation (gene change) in the affected individual.  Approximately 50% of affected individuals have the condition as a result of a new mutation.  The risk of passing the abnormal gene from affected parent to offspring is 50% for each pregnancy regardless of the sex of the resulting child. The prevalence of Townes-Brock syndrome is not known but has been estimated to be at least 1 in 250,000 births.  This condition affects males and females in equal numbers. The diagnosis of Townes-Brocks syndrome is based on clinical symptoms. Molecular genetic testing for mutations in the SALL1 gene is available to confirm the diagnosis.","Townes-Brock syndrome, TBS, Townes-Brocks syndrome","autosomal dominant genetic disorder, polydactyly, Mental retardation, imperforate anus, Dominant genetic disorders",,"short third toe, abnormal ears, Abnormalities of the eye, overlapping toes, underdeveloped kidneys, Congenital sensorineural, flat feet, Feet anomalies, Kidney dysfunction, imperforate anus, Abnormalities in the heart, Mental retardation, thumb malformations, Abnormalities of the spine, kidney anomalies, folded rim of skin and cartilage around the outer ear, preaxial polydactyly, triphalangeal thumbs, Small ears, Abnormalities in the kidneys, horseshoe kidney, hearing impairment, polycystic kidneys, kidney malformations, Abnormalities in the feet, displaced or rotated kidneys, Abnormalities of the heart, conductive hearing loss"
97,Mandibuloacral-Dysplasia,"Approximately 40 cases of mandibuloacral dysplasia have been reported in the medical literature.

99,Schindler-disease,"Schindler disease is a rare inherited metabolic disorder characterized by the deficient activity of the lysosomal enzyme alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase (alpha-NAGA or alpha-galactosidase B). The enzyme defect leads to the abnormal accumulation of certain complex compounds (glycosphingolipids, glycoproteins, and oligosaccharides), which have terminal or preterminal N-acetylgalactosaminyl residues in many tissues of the body and in urine. Two major forms of Schindler disease exist - a severe form with onset in infancy (type I) and a milder form with onset in adulthood (type II). Some researchers have proposed a type III form of Schindler disease that is less severe than type I, but more severe than type II. The specific symptoms and severity of Schindler disease can vary from one person to another. Schindler disease is caused by mutations of the NAGA gene and is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. Schindler disease affects males and females in equal numbers. The exact incidence of Schindler disease in the general population is unknown. Because cases of Schindler disease may go unrecognized or misdiagnosed, determining the disorder’s true frequency in the general population is difficult. As a group, lysosomal storage diseases are infrequent, although certain disorders may occur in specific ethnic or demographic groups at higher frequencies, about one in every 1,000-2,000 live births for Gaucher and Fabry diseases, or very infrequently (1 in 100,000 to 200,000 live births) for most of these disorders, which may be the case for alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase deficiency. Schindler disease was first reported in the medical literature in the late 1980s.","Schindler disease type II, Schindler disease, Gaucher diseases, Schindler disease type I, alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase deficiency, Fabry diseases, type III Schindler disease","inherited metabolic disorder, ysosomal storage diseases",,"deficient activity of the lysosomal enzyme alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase, abnormal accumulation of glycosphingolipids, glycoproteins, and oligosaccharides"

101,Acanthosis-Nigricans,"Acanthosis nigricans (AN) is a skin condition characterized by abnormally increased coloration (hyperpigmentation) and ""velvety"" thickening (hyperkeratosis) of the skin, particularly of skin fold regions, such as of the neck and groin and under the arms (axillae). Various benign (non-cancerous) forms of AN have been identified in which the disorder may be inherited as a primary condition or associated with various underlying syndromes, an excess accumulation of body fat (obesity), or the use of certain medications (i.e., drug-induced AN). In other instances, AN may occur in association with an underlying cancerous tumor (i.e., malignant AN).",,"skin condition, obesity, Acanthosis nigricans, malignant AN, AN, drug-induced AN",,"of the skin hyperpigmentation, hyperkeratosis of the skin"

Recurrent pain and stiffness occur in conjunction with thickening, swelling and tenderness in soft tissue overlying the lunate bone. The range of motion in the wrist may become limited. Kienböck Disease is characterized by degenerative changes in the lunate bone of the wrist.  Softening, deterioration, fragmentation or compression of the affected bone can occur.  These changes may produce pain, swelling, tenderness, thickening and/or stiffness in the overlying tissues of the wrist.  The range of motion may become restricted.  Many individuals with Kienböck Disease have a shorter ulna than radius (negative ulnar variance).  Healing occurs through formation of new bone in some cases. The exact cause of Kienböck Disease is not known.  However, it is believed to be caused by inflammation or injury of the wrist. Kienböck Disease usually begins during childhood and seems to affect females more often than males.

103,Barakat-Syndrome,"Patients may present with symptoms associated with low blood calcium (hypocalcemia) such as muscle weakness, tetany, and convulsions, or findings related to kidney disease such as proteinuria, hematuria, and nephrotic syndrome. Deafness may be a presenting symptom or may be found on a routine hearing test. Since prenatal ultrasound is now a routine, congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract may be the presenting finding. The exact prevalence is unknown, but the disease is considered to be very rare.  So far, about 180 patients have been reported from various countries including the United States, Japan, India, China, Europe and the Middle East. There is equal prevalence across ethnic groups, genders and ages of diagnosis. Clinical awareness of this syndrome will probably increase the number of patients diagnosed. Differential diagnoses of the syndrome include familial idiopathic hypoparathyroidism, progressive sensorineural deafness without renal disease, autosomal recessive hypoparathyroidism with renal insufficiency and developmental delay, and deletion 22q11 syndrome.
