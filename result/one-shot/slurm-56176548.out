The epidemiology of mesenteric panniculitis has not been fully defined. A recent study reported that findings consistent with mesenteric panniculitis occurred in 359 patients (0.24%) from a total of 147,794 abdominal computed tomography (CT) examinations undertaken for over a 5-year period in a large community based medical system. Of these, 100 patients (28%) had known malignancy or were later diagnosed with cancer. In some reports, mesenteric panniculitis has a male predominance of 2:1. Mesenteric panniculitis most often appears during the sixth and seventh decade of life, and its incidence appears to increase with age. Children and adolescents are less commonly affected, possibly related to a lesser amount of fat in their mesentery, but more importantly because of specific characteristics of this form of autoimmunity. Symptoms of the mesenteric panniculitis mimic those of a number of other benign and malignant conditions. Because of this, it is important to rule out other diseases prior to confirming the diagnosis of mesenteric panniculitis. Infectious causes range from viral, bacterial (including V. cholerae) and parasitic infections. There are also a variety of diseases that are associated with mesenteric abnormalities on abdominal imaging. Such conditions include primary or metastatic mesentery cancer, gastrointestinal lymphoma, desmoid tumors, inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis), Crohn’s disease, idiopathic nodular panniculitis, locally advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma, retroperitoneal fibrosis and other sclerotic diseases as mentioned above.
### Output:
inflammation of the pancreas, mesenteric abnormalities

Medullary Sponge Kidney is a rare disorder characterized by the formation of cystic malformations in the collecting ducts and the tubular structures within the kidneys (tubules) that collect urine. One or both kidneys may be affected. The initial symptoms of this disorder may include blood in the urine (hematuria), calcium stone formation in the kidneys (nephrolithiasis) or infection. The exact cause of Medullary Sponge Kidney is not known. The exact cause of Medullary Sponge Kidney is not known and most cases occur sporadically for no apparent reason.  Some cases are thought to run in families (familial) and may be inherited as an autosomal dominant genetic trait.  However, this inheritance pattern has not been proven.  Some studies have suggested there may be a a possible relationship between overactivity of the parathyroid gland (Hyperparathyroidism) and Medullary Sponge Kidney. Medullary Sponge Kidney is a rare disorder that affects slightly more women than men.  It is thought to occur in 1 in 1,000 to 5,000 people in the United States.  Although the symptoms of Medullary Sponge Kidney may begin at any age, they usually develop during adolescence or in adults between the ages of 30 and 50 years.  Approximately 13 percent of all people who develop kidney stones are eventually diagnosed with Medullary Sponge Kidney. Medullary Sponge Kidney may also develop in people with Beckwith-Wiedemann Syndrome.  (For more information on Beckwith-Wiedemann Syndrome, see the related disorders section of this report.)

Burning Mouth Syndrome, also known as glossodynia, oral dysesthesia, sore mouth, stomatodynia and stomatopyrosis, is a condition in which the patient has a burning sensation in the mouth, or other uncomfortable oral sensation, in the absence of any clinically detectable dental or oral mucosal abnormality.  The burning sensation may be localized to one or more specific areas of the mouth, or it may be diffuse. The most common areas of sensation are the tongue, lips, gums and the underside of the tongue.
### Output:
burning mouth syndrome

Burning mouth syndrome is a rare dis
