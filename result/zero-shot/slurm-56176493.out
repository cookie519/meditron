The `load_in_4bit` and `load_in_8bit` arguments are deprecated and will be removed in the future versions. Please, pass a `BitsAndBytesConfig` object in `quantization_config` argument instead.

Special tokens have been added in the vocabulary, make sure the associated word embeddings are fine-tuned or trained.
Asking to truncate to max_length but no maximum length is provided and the model has no predefined maximum length. Default to no truncation.

Prompt:
### Task: 
Extract the exact name or names of signs from the input text and output them in a list. only list the exact name from the text, do not explain.
### Definition:
Signs are defined as physical or mental problems that can be measured from tests or observed by a doctor.
### Input Text: 
Autoimmune hepatitis is a rare disorder that affects females 4 times as often as males. Type 1 is more common and is usually diagnosed in adults. Type 2 is more common in children and often involves a more severe disease process. There are also variant types of AIH; these include individuals with AIH and one of the other autoimmune liver diseases (primary sclerosing cholangitis or primary biliary cholangitis).Those with other autoimmune conditions have a 25-50% chance of developing another one and thus a higher risk for developing AIH. The new cases per year (incidence) are estimated at 1-2 per 100,000 and total cases (prevalence) are approximately 24 per 100,000. Studies suggest that the incidence of AIH is increasing and the reason is unknown.
### Output:

Generated:

A list of signs of AIH with the exact name.
